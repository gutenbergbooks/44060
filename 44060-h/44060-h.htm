<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS BLUE-EYED BOY</span></h2>
<p>Jo Ann jerked the crude, hand-made chair off
the oxcart and set it down in the shade of the
thatched roof of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your throne&rsquo;s ready, Your Majesty,&rdquo; she
called over gaily to the pale, worn-looking Mrs.
Blackwell whose daughter Florence was helping
her off the burro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever heard of a throne looking like
that?&rdquo; laughed the slender, hazel-eyed girl beside
Jo Ann. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo; She spread a
bright rainbow-hued Mexican blanket over the
chair. &ldquo;Now that looks more like a throne.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>Jo Ann nodded her dark curly bob. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
right, Peg&mdash;as usual.&rdquo; She turned to Mrs. Blackwell.
&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re dead tired. That long automobile
trip over the rough roads was bad
enough, but the ride up the mountain on that
poky donkey was worse yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poky&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; put in Florence, her blue
eyes twinkling. &ldquo;That burro, or donkey as you
call it, is all Mexican&mdash;slow but sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she had finished speaking, the burro
flapped his ears, threw back his head, and
brayed such a knowing &ldquo;heehaw&rdquo; that the girls
laughed merrily and even Mrs. Blackwell smiled
broadly.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Blackwell dropped down in the
chair, Jo Ann remarked to her, &ldquo;No queen ever
had a more beautiful kingdom to look upon from
her throne than you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s marvelous!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy as all four
gazed over the far-flung view stretching out before
them: rugged, cloud-tipped mountain
peaks, the deep valley covered with tropical
growth, and a gleaming, silver waterfall to their
right.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; broke in Florence finally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
never get the house straightened at this rate. And
will you look at that driver! I believe he&rsquo;s sound
asleep. He hasn&rsquo;t taken a single thing off the cart
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jo Ann reluctantly turned away, she called
over to Peggy, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have three or four weeks
to enjoy all this beauty&mdash;let&rsquo;s get busy now and
help Florence straighten up the house. You just
sit here, Mrs. Blackwell, and draw in deep
breaths of this invigorating air,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Dr.
Blackwell said you weren&rsquo;t to turn your hand to
do a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls wait on me as if I were a complete
invalid. Although I am tired now, I know I&rsquo;m
going to regain my strength rapidly up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Florence gave orders in Spanish to the
driver and the boy in charge of the burros, Jo
Ann and Peggy went inside the small, one-room
house which was built from stone cut from the
mountain side.</p>
<p>While they were waiting for the equipment
to be brought in, the girls looked about the room
curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the queerest little house!&rdquo; Peggy
exclaimed. &ldquo;Not a single window in it. It&rsquo;s built
exactly like the little adobe huts the peons live
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence said they bought the place from a
Mexican&mdash;anyone&rsquo;d know that at a glance.&rdquo; Jo
Ann walked over across the room to the back
door and looked outside. &ldquo;This must be that
funny little kitchen Florence told us about,&rdquo; she
said, gesturing to a small stone building about
fifteen feet beyond.</p>
<p>Just then the driver sauntered in and piled
some cots and bedding in the center of the cement
floor.</p>
<p>Jo Ann wheeled about. &ldquo;Come on, Peg, let&rsquo;s
sweep out the house and make up the cots. We
can do that much, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they had the cots made up, the
Mexicans had finished unloading and were starting
off leisurely down the trail behind the oxcart
and burros.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop working now and eat our lunch,&rdquo;
called Florence from the kitchen door. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
siesta time right now, and it&rsquo;ll do all of us good
to take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy grinned over at Florence. &ldquo;Maybe Jo
Ann&rsquo;ll take a siesta up here. Remember the
trouble she got into up on the roof in town during
a siesta hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me this time. There&rsquo;s no
mysterious window in this house for me to investigate,
as there was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet we won&rsquo;t be here three days before
you&rsquo;ll find some mystery to solve, Sherlock,&rdquo;
teased Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sherlock&rsquo;s too hungry to look for mysteries
now. Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;You
girls unpack the eats while I go to the spring for
some cool water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had eaten their lunch and had their
siestas, the girls worked another hour putting
down rugs, arranging gay pillows and blankets
on the cots, and making a dressing table out of a
packing box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before we start straightening out things in
the kitchen, I believe I&rsquo;d better go down to the
goat ranch,&rdquo; Florence remarked. &ldquo;I want to see
if I can make arrangements to get milk there
every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;goat&rsquo;s milk?&rdquo; Peggy asked in
dismay, stopping in the middle of slipping a gay
cretonne cover on a pillow.</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s eyes twinkled roguishly. &ldquo;Well,
what&rsquo;s the matter with goat&rsquo;s milk? That&rsquo;s what
the Mexicans use. When in Mexico do as the
Mexicans do.&rdquo; Seeing the sick-looking expression
on both Peggy&rsquo;s and Jo Ann&rsquo;s faces, she
hastened to explain: &ldquo;I was just teasing. They
raise the goats for market. The natives are as
fond of goat&rsquo;s meat as they are of the milk. They
had a cow at this ranch when we were here last
year, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope they still have that cow,&rdquo; put in
Peggy quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say I,&rdquo; added Jo Ann emphatically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Florence picked up the bucket from the rough
board table. &ldquo;Do either of you girls want to go
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo, I know you&rsquo;re just dying to get out of
doors and tramp a bit,&rdquo; Peggy remarked. &ldquo;You
go with Florence, and I&rsquo;ll stay here with Mrs.
Blackwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;d love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; Florence told her
mother as she and Jo Ann started out the door.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they disappeared down
a winding trail back of the house. About halfway
down the trail Jo Ann halted a moment to
enjoy the beautiful scenery. &ldquo;This is the life for
me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I had a good time in the
city, but give me the outdoors. I can hardly wait
to begin exploring these mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About ten minutes later they came in sight of
a little pink adobe hut perched on a narrow ledge
jutting out from the steep rocky cliff. It looked
to Jo Ann as if the hut might topple off any minute
and fall into the valley below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the goat ranch,&rdquo; explained Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The goat ranch! All I see is a hut and a stone
wall. Why&rsquo;d they build a house way up there
instead of in that fertile valley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because that steep cliff back of
the hut saved them from so much work in making
an enclosure for their goats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any goats. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little goat herder takes them out every
morning to graze on the scrubby mesquite that
grows on the mountain side. Goats love to climb,
you know. I&rsquo;ve even seen one on top of an adobe
hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls followed the trail across a narrow
ravine and up to the house.</p>
<p>Just then several dogs began barking, and a
black-eyed, olive-skinned Mexican woman and
two scantily dressed, barefooted children appeared
in the doorway.</p>
<p>The next moment the woman&rsquo;s face lit at sight
of Florence. &ldquo;Florencita!&rdquo; she cried, then went
on in a rapid flow of Spanish to ask her numerous
questions about her family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>As soon as Florence had answered these questions
she inquired if they still owned the cow.</p>
<p>The woman nodded assent and urged her and
Jo Ann to sit down and rest till Pablito brought
the cow and she could milk.</p>
<p>Florence shook her head and handing her the
bucket asked if it would be possible for her to
send the milk up later by one of the children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, Florencita. <i>Muy bien</i>,&rdquo; she agreed, smiling.</p>
<p>As the girls turned to go, the woman reached
down and picked a fragrant, waxy-white flower
from the jasmine growing in a pot by the door.
&ldquo;For your mama,&rdquo; she explained, handing it to
Florence.</p>
<p>With a word of thanks and an &ldquo;<i>Adios</i>&rdquo; to her
and the children, the girls started back down the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home the long way through the valley,&rdquo;
suggested Florence when they reached the
ravine. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a cave down this way that I
want to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! The longer the way, the better. That
cave sounds interesting, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slipping and sliding down the rocky mountain
side, they soon reached the broad valley;
then they followed the path around the base of
the cliff, stopping now and then to gather ferns
and flowers.</p>
<p>When they came to a sparkling, crystal-clear
spring bubbling out from under the rocks, Jo
Ann dropped to her knees and drank thirstily of
the icy cold water.</p>
<p>While Florence was drinking, Jo Ann heard
a snapping of twigs near by. She wheeled about
and, peering through the bushes, saw two small
boys gathering wood. One of them was bent over
by the weight of a large bundle of the wood,
held in place on his back by a rope passed across
his forehead; the other was chopping sticks with
a machete, a long heavy knife. At first glance Jo
Ann thought they must be twins, as they were
dressed alike in the loose white trousers and
blouse worn by the peon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>A few minutes later the boys stepped back into
the narrow trail, but on seeing the girls they
quickly moved to one side to let them pass.</p>
<p>With a smile, Florence greeted the boys with
the customary salutation, &ldquo;<i>buenos tardes</i>.&rdquo; Their
little brown faces under their frayed straw sombreros
grinned back at the girls as they returned
the greeting; then they turned and went on down
the trail.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of sight Jo Ann
exclaimed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first blue-eyed Mexican
I&rsquo;ve seen! I didn&rsquo;t know they ever had blue
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you notice that one of those boys had
dark-blue eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were both dressed alike, and dirty and
ragged. All I noticed was how frail-looking the
one was who had the bundle of wood on his
back. I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why the other
boy, who looked stronger, didn&rsquo;t take part of the
load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one with the blue eyes. Do they
belong to the family at the goat ranch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never seen them before. You must
be mistaken about the boy&rsquo;s having blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head vigorously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive
his eyes were blue&mdash;his features were finer
too, but his face was so dirty I couldn&rsquo;t tell much
about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a fine imagination,
Jo&mdash;trying to find another mystery already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t try to find this mystery. It bumped
right into me. If that boy lives around here, I&rsquo;m
going to find out more about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Jo Ann&rsquo;s emphatic words, Florence
laughed merrily. &ldquo;All right, but don&rsquo;t start now.
If we&rsquo;re going to stop at the cave, we&rsquo;ll have to
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">NEIGHBORS IN THE CAVE</span></h2>
<p>The two girls hurried along the trail, and a
few minutes later Florence pointed to a dark,
shadowy place about fifty feet up the side of the
cliff. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the cave I was telling you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can see through the bushes is a black
hole under some rocks. Can we climb up there?
I&rsquo;d like to explore it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s a path leading up to it. It isn&rsquo;t
very large and won&rsquo;t take you long to look it
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After rounding a curve in the trail, Florence
led the way up the winding path toward the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; she exclaimed a moment
later. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a burro tied right outside the entrance.
Someone must be in there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I smell smoke from a campfire, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann in a low voice as she moved
over closer to Florence. &ldquo;Do you suppose we&rsquo;d
better go on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think it&rsquo;ll be all right. If we have
neighbors, I want to see what sort of people they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then they saw, silhouetted against the dark
cave entrance, the bent form of an old woman
leaning on a stick. On coming closer the girls
were able to make out the features of a brown,
wrinkled face, which was almost hidden by the
folds of the black shawl-like <i>rebosa</i> about her
head and shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Buenos tardes</i>,&rdquo; greeted Florence, then went
on to explain in Spanish that they had come up
to see the cave, not knowing that it was occupied.</p>
<p>While Florence was talking to the old woman,
Jo Ann was peering into the dark opening beyond.
By the light of the fire in the middle of the
floor she could see a woman kneeling by a stone
<i>metate</i> grinding corn for <i>tortillas</i>, and near by,
lying on a straw mat on the floor, was a tiny
naked baby.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>Just then several little stair-step children ran
to peer up at the visitors from behind their
grandmother. Jo Ann took some of the flowers
from her bouquet and offered one to each of
them. With smiles spreading over their thin,
grimy faces, they reached out timidly for the
flowers, then drew back behind their grandmother
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked the largest
of the children in her best Spanish, but either
the child could not understand or else she was
too timid to reply.</p>
<p>Hearing a slight noise behind her, Jo Ann
turned in time to see the two boys she had noticed
gathering wood. The one with the heavy burden
on his back passed on into the cave without looking
around, but the other hesitated and stared up
at her curiously before disappearing into the dim
interior. In that short interval Jo Ann had an
opportunity to see that his eyes were unmistakably
a deep blue; moreover, she noticed that, although
his skin was brown, it was not as dark as
the other boy&rsquo;s and the little girls&rsquo;.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>While she was pondering over this difference,
Florence reached over and touched her on the
arm. &ldquo;Come on, Jo, we&rsquo;d better go now. We&rsquo;ll
come down again sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls waved good-by to the children, then
started off down the trail. &ldquo;Did you notice those
boys as they came in?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked. &ldquo;One of
them has blue eyes, just as I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so busy talking to the grandmother that
I didn&rsquo;t see them till they had passed on into the
shadows. Evidently they belong to this family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that blue-eyed one certainly doesn&rsquo;t
look as if he belongs to them. There&rsquo;s something
strange about him. Do you suppose they live in
that cave? They didn&rsquo;t have a stick of furniture&mdash;not
even a bed or table or chair or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter to the peons. They
never sleep on a bed, and they eat off the floor.
But those people did look awfully poor. I don&rsquo;t
believe they had a thing for supper but those <i>tortillas</i>
the woman was making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come down here tomorrow and bring
them something. Those children looked half
starved to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that very thing, but if we&rsquo;re going
to eat tonight, we&rsquo;d better be getting back to
camp. Mother and Peg&rsquo;ll wonder what&rsquo;s happened
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we haven&rsquo;t finished straightening up the
kitchen, either,&rdquo; Jo Ann sighed. &ldquo;How about
cooking supper in that outdoor fireplace? It&rsquo;s
too gorgeous up here to stay in the house any
more than absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d planned to do anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the road we came up this morning?&rdquo;
Jo Ann asked a moment later, as they came
to a cart road winding back and forth up the
steep mountain side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re almost home. If it weren&rsquo;t for the
trees, we could see the house from here. There&rsquo;s
a short cut straight up the mountain.&rdquo; She
pointed to a narrow path between the trees and
rocks. &ldquo;Since you&rsquo;re so fond of climbing, we&rsquo;ll
take that and be back at the house before you
know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a short time they arrived at the house, puffing
and panting from the exertion of their steep
climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;think we&mdash;were never&mdash;coming?&rdquo;
asked Florence, dropping down beside her
mother, who was lying on a cot out in front of
the house; then, without waiting for an answer,
she asked, &ldquo;Have they brought the milk yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mother nodded. &ldquo;Just a few minutes ago.
Did you and Jo Ann have a nice walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed! It seemed so good to be tramping
over the mountains again.&rdquo; Florence smiled.
&ldquo;I had to recount the family history from A to
Z to the woman at the goat ranch, and she said it
gave her much sorrow to learn of your illness.
She and all the children&rsquo;ll probably be up to see
you tomorrow. Here&rsquo;s a jasmine she sent you&mdash;we
picked the fern down by a spring.&rdquo; She
sniffed the fragrant perfume a moment, then
handed the dainty spray to her mother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And while we were at the spring,&rdquo; put in Jo
Ann, &ldquo;we saw two little Mexican boys gathering
wood; and I&rsquo;m sure one of them had blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jo thinks she&rsquo;s on the trail of another
mystery,&rdquo; laughed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; sighed Peggy with a roguish twinkle
in her eyes. &ldquo;I told you we wouldn&rsquo;t be here
three days before she&rsquo;d find a mystery, and here
it&rsquo;s hardly been that many hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when we were at the cave,&rdquo; Jo Ann
went on, unruffled by Peggy&rsquo;s teasing, &ldquo;the boys
came in, and I got a good look at that one&rsquo;s eyes,
and they were blue&mdash;a deep, deep blue&mdash;bluer
than yours, Florence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s your solution?&rdquo; grinned Peggy.
&ldquo;Has your blue-eyed boy been kidnaped, or is
he a prince in disguise?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later. Give me a little time, and
I&rsquo;ll find out. Florence and I are going down to
the cave tomorrow to carry some food to those
children&mdash;there were several thin, dirty, half-starved
little ones there. Come along, Peg, and
if that boy is there, you can see for yourself that
his eyes are blue. I hope he is&mdash;I want to prove
to you and Florence that I&rsquo;m not color blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &rsquo;most as hungry as those children
looked,&rdquo; put in Florence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann sprang up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a swell fire-builder.
I&rsquo;ll build the fire this minute&mdash;in the outdoor
fireplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve beat you to it,&rdquo; laughed
Peggy.</p>
<p>As they went through the house, Jo Ann
noticed that a gay red-and-white checked cloth
had been spread on the table and places set for
four. &ldquo;You have been busy, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she
said motioning toward the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Mrs. Blackwell told me what to do
with things, and I&rsquo;ve straightened up the kitchen
and put some rice on to cook for supper.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Just as they reached the kitchen door, Florence
came up and slipped her arm around Peggy
affectionately, &ldquo;Peg, you&rsquo;re a grand person to
have around; Jo&rsquo;s been dreading straightening
this kitchen all the way home.&rdquo; She smiled over
at Jo Ann, then went on to the kitchen and took
several articles out of a box near the door.
&ldquo;Here, Jo, if you&rsquo;ll fry the bacon and scramble
some eggs, I&rsquo;ll make some real Mexican <i>chocolate</i>;
then if you&rsquo;ll open this jar of preserves,
Peg, we&rsquo;ll have supper ready in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even that won&rsquo;t be soon enough to suit me,&rdquo;
laughed Jo Ann. &ldquo;That climb up the mountain
and this invigorating air have made me hungry
as a bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a very short time supper was ready, and as
Jo Ann placed the platter of bacon and eggs on
the table, she called over to Peggy, &ldquo;Catch hold
of the other end of this table and let&rsquo;s carry it
outside. That sunset&rsquo;s just too gorgeous to miss,
and then Mrs. Blackwell won&rsquo;t have to walk so
far, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Carefully Peggy and Jo Ann carried the table
out in front of the house and set it down near
Mrs. Blackwell&rsquo;s cot; then Florence brought a
chair and placed it at the head of the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The banquet is served, Your Majesty.&rdquo; She
turned to help her mother into the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No banquet hall was ever as beautiful as
this.&rdquo; Jo Ann waved her hand toward the deep
purple valley, the gold-tipped mountain peaks,
and the rainbow-hued canopy overhead. &ldquo;And
listen&mdash;the music of the little mountain folk
singing their farewells to the sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely have a good, imagination, Jo,&rdquo;
commented Peggy, laughing. &ldquo;It is perfectly
grand, but all I can hear is the croaking of bullfrogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your appreciation of the beauties of nature
seems to be sadly lacking.&rdquo; She smiled condescendingly
at Peggy, then turned to Mrs.
Blackwell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that the doctor at
the sanitarium, and your husband, too, ordered
you up here to recuperate after your long illness.
You couldn&rsquo;t help but get well here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell nodded assent. &ldquo;Yes, this is a
wonderful place to rest. I really begin to feel
stronger already&mdash;and with three such thoughtful
girls to look after me I&rsquo;m sure I shall be as
well as ever in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;re here with us and not &rsquo;way
off there at that sanitarium,&rdquo; said Florence,
reaching over to squeeze her mother&rsquo;s hand.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to take such good care of you that
you&rsquo;ll just have to get well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired out from the busy, strenuous day, they
lingered long over their supper, watching the
ever changing colors of the slow tropical sunset.
Carmine melted into rose, amber, violet,
finally fading away into a soft tender green.
Deep purple shadows settled over the mountains
as the colors faded, and a slender crescent of
a moon peeped down at them from a star-flecked
sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>Suddenly the spell was broken as Florence
jumped to her feet. &ldquo;Gracious! I forgot all about
fixing that box down at the spring to keep our
milk and butter in. Does anyone know where my
flashlight is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I put it on the dressing table right beside
your cot. I&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo; Peggy jumped up and ran
inside the house. A moment later she returned
with the flashlight and handed it to Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you and fix the box if you&rsquo;ll tell
me what to do,&rdquo; offered Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First we&rsquo;d better light some candles so we
can see what we&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; Florence said as the
three of them went into the kitchen. She dived
down into the box and brought out two tallow
candles and handed them to Jo Ann. &ldquo;When you
get those lit, Peg and I&rsquo;ll put the milk and butter
in jars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I do with them now I&rsquo;ve got them
lit, Florence&mdash;hold them?&rdquo; grinned Jo Ann a
moment later, holding a lighted candle in each
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick them on these lids and put them on the
table. Here&rsquo;s the box I&rsquo;d planned to use. We&rsquo;ll
put the things in it and then carry it down to the
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The spring! Do you mean that spring where
we saw the two boys&mdash;my blue-eyed boy?&rdquo; Jo
Ann asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, silly. I mean the spring back
of the house where we get our drinking water.
There&rsquo;re springs all over these mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They placed the things in the box, then, with
Florence leading the way with the flashlight,
they carried it to the near-by spring.</p>
<p>After they had moved several stones aside,
they placed the jars of milk and butter in the icy
water, placed the package of bacon on top of the
jars and then turned the box over all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pile some stones around the box and put this
big one on top, and then our refrigerator&rsquo;ll be
fixed,&rdquo; Florence said.</p>
<p>As soon as they returned to the house and had
washed the dishes, they began getting ready for
bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize how tired I was till now. I
won&rsquo;t need any rocking tonight, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Jo
Ann said as she crawled under the blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Her thoughts drifted back to the blue-eyed
boy. Who was he, and why was he with those
peons? There must be some mystery back of it
all. Could it be possible that he had been kidnaped
as Peggy had jokingly suggested? &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going down there early tomorrow morning and
find out more about it,&rdquo; she told herself before
dropping off to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">AN UNWELCOME VISITOR</span></h2>
<p>When Jo Ann opened her eyes the next morning,
the sun was already shining through the
open doorway. She lay still a moment and tried
to think why she had wanted to get up early.
What had she planned to do? Then it all came
back to her. She was going down to the cave to
find out more about the blue-eyed boy.</p>
<p>She threw back the covers and sprang up
quickly, but the next moment she dropped back
with a stifled groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Jo?&rdquo; whispered Peggy.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stiff or sore, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;of course not! I just groaned for the
fun of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason I didn&rsquo;t want to go with you
girls down to the goat ranch yesterday. I knew
I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to move today if I did. I&rsquo;m
going to take my climbing in smaller doses, so it
won&rsquo;t be so painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then they heard a groan from the other
end of the room, and both girls raised up on their
elbows to look over at Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sore too?&rdquo; Jo Ann called out loud
when she saw that Mrs. Blackwell was also
awake now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say I am! It&rsquo;s agony to move. We&rsquo;ll have
to climb some more today to get limbered up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re going to do just
as soon as breakfast&rsquo;s over. You remember we
planned to take some food to those children
down at the cave. I want to show you and Peggy
my blue-eyed boy, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;I surely hope you get to satisfy
your curiosity about him&mdash;we won&rsquo;t have
a minute&rsquo;s peace till you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we&rsquo;re going down there this morning,
we&rsquo;d better roll out.&rdquo; Florence screwed up
her face and began slowly crawling out of bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>Peggy smiled at the ridiculous contortions Jo
Ann and Florence went through as they got up
and began dressing.</p>
<p>Finally Jo Ann picked up a shoe and pitched
it across at her. &ldquo;You will laugh at me, will
you?&rdquo; she said good-naturedly. &ldquo;Roll out yourself,
or I&rsquo;ll pour some cold water in your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann finished dressing first, and as she went
out the door she called back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make the fire
while you girls finish dressing; then it won&rsquo;t take
us long to get breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later she was joined by Peggy
and Florence, and all three girls set to work getting
the breakfast started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set the table,&rdquo; offered Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get the things from our refrigerator
at the spring,&rdquo; added Jo Ann, and started off
stiff-legged down the path. &ldquo;The walk&rsquo;ll help to
limber me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jo ought to have a prize for her graceful
walk,&rdquo; smiled Peggy as she started into the house
to set the table, while Florence went for some
wood to replenish the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>A few minutes later Jo Ann came running
back empty-handed, her sore muscles forgotten.
&ldquo;Our food&rsquo;s gone&mdash;everything&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; she
called excitedly to Florence.</p>
<p>The wood dropped from Florence&rsquo;s hands and
sent up a shower of sparks as it fell into the fire.
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Are you sure you looked
in the right place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. The box&rsquo;s turned over, and there&rsquo;s
nothing under it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Peggy, hearing the excitement,
rushed out of the house, and all three girls raced
back to the spring, then stood staring at the overturned
box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think happened?&rdquo; asked Jo
Ann. &ldquo;Do you suppose someone stole the things
and left the box there so it&rsquo;d look as if a dog had
done it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so,&rdquo; replied Florence thoughtfully.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one up here who&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
stopped abruptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been those people down at the
cave who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jo Ann; then the next
moment she answered her own question: &ldquo;No, I
know they didn&rsquo;t do it. They&rsquo;re poor, but I don&rsquo;t
believe they&rsquo;d steal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy looked over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;How do you
know? You can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dropping to her knees beside the spring Jo
Ann began examining the moss-covered stones.
&ldquo;The moss is scraped off this rock where something
heavy stepped on it, but then we could&rsquo;ve
done that last night when we put the things in
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned and started back toward the
house. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good to stand here talking
about it. Come on, we&rsquo;ll find something else
to cook in place of the bacon for breakfast. It&rsquo;s
a good thing we brought some canned milk
along for an emergency, but we&rsquo;ll have to do
without butter for several days, till I can get
some sent out from the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann ran to catch up with Peggy and Florence.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t you get some butter from the
people down at the goat ranch?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Florence laughed. &ldquo;Why, they probably
wouldn&rsquo;t even know what I was talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they use butter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the peons never use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s get extra milk and make it
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? We haven&rsquo;t a churn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen my mother make butter by stirring
the cream in a bowl or jar,&rdquo; Jo Ann explained.</p>
<p>Just then they reached the house, and all three
ran on inside and began telling Mrs. Blackwell
of their loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Blackwell, what is your opinion about
the mysterious visitor&mdash;was he man or beast?&rdquo;
asked Jo Ann finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say, of course, but it seems to me
an animal would hardly carry off the glass jars
of milk and butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann stared at Mrs. Blackwell a moment.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; she said, then turned
and went on outside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>Peggy glanced over at Florence. &ldquo;Everything
seems to point to those people as the guilty
parties, doesn&rsquo;t it? Jo hates to admit it, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, it wasn&rsquo;t much, and anyway, we
can&rsquo;t prove that they are the guilty ones. Let&rsquo;s
forget about it and see what we can find for
breakfast.&rdquo; She got up and went out in the
kitchen with Jo Ann.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Peggy joined them, and
before long they had the emergency breakfast
ready: coffee, dry cereal with canned milk, batter
cakes with brown sugar syrup, and oranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t half bad, if you ask me,&rdquo; bragged
Peggy as they sat down to the table.</p>
<p>Jo Ann grinned. &ldquo;Just see who fixed it! Why,
we&rsquo;re the best cooks for miles around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t saying much, is it?&rdquo; smiled Florence,
then all four laughed merrily as they
caught Florence&rsquo;s hidden meaning.</p>
<p>As soon as the breakfast things were cleared
away and the house straightened up, Jo Ann
asked, &ldquo;Florence, do you and Peg still want to
go down to the cave with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. Come on, let&rsquo;s see what we
can find to carry to those children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls hastened to the kitchen, and
Florence began searching through the provision
box for something to take to the children at the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;re some <i>frijoles</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s their principal
food, and I know they&rsquo;ll like them. We&rsquo;ll put in
some rice, and with these onions and garlic and
this can of tomatoes they can make <i>sopa de aroz</i>&mdash;a
kind of stew.&rdquo; As Florence handed the
things to Jo Ann and Peggy, they packed them
in a split-cane basket.</p>
<p>She looked about the kitchen a moment, then
reached over on the table and picked up a bag
of oranges and handed it to Jo Ann. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;re
some oranges. They ought to have some fruit,
too. There&rsquo;re only half a dozen in there, but
that&rsquo;ll be enough for each of the children to
have one apiece. Let&rsquo;s take these batter cakes we
had left from breakfast. They&rsquo;ll love them.
They&rsquo;ll think they&rsquo;re some kind of a cake. We&rsquo;ll
put in this cone of brown sugar and tell the
woman how to make syrup&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll very
likely eat the sugar as it is, thinking it&rsquo;s candy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I couldn&rsquo;t get milk from the goat
ranch for them,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
see about it the next time we go down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had finished, Jo Ann picked up
the basket and followed Florence and Peggy out
on the front porch, where Mrs. Blackwell was
lying in a hammock stretched between two of
the crude peeled posts supporting the thatched
roof.</p>
<p>Florence leaned over to drop a kiss on her
mother&rsquo;s pale cheek. &ldquo;Do you mind if we leave
you alone for a little while? We&rsquo;re going down
to the cave to carry some food to those poor little
children&mdash;we won&rsquo;t be gone over half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to prove to Florence and Peg that
I&rsquo;m right about that blue-eyed boy,&rdquo; added Jo
Ann. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to find out something
that&rsquo;ll throw some light on the mystery of his
blue eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell smiled. &ldquo;You girls run along&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
take a nap while you&rsquo;re gone. I&rsquo;m very
glad you&rsquo;re adopting those children. From what
you&rsquo;ve told me they must be badly in need of a
helping hand. You see evidences of real poverty
down here among the peons, and yet, as a general
thing, they&rsquo;re very happy.&rdquo; As they started
off down the trail she called, &ldquo;Jo, I wish you
luck in solving the mystery of your blue-eyed
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and Jo Ann found it very painful
going down the steep path. Their leg muscles
were still stiff and sore from their long tramp
over the mountain side the day before. They
were glad when they reached the foot of the
cliff and started on a smooth wooded trail
around its base.</p>
<p>At the first curve they stopped to gaze across
the broad valley stretching out before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this glorious!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed. &ldquo;We
almost beat the sun up&mdash;down here, didn&rsquo;t
we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it wasn&rsquo;t much ahead of us,&rdquo; agreed
Peggy, &ldquo;and doesn&rsquo;t the air smell good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three girls drew in deep breaths of the
fragrant, woodsy odor of leaf mold and dew-kissed
ferns.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they turned and hurried
along the trail till they reached the narrow, unused
path leading up to the cave. As they came
in sight of it, Jo Ann stopped abruptly and stood
staring before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea of stopping so suddenly?&rdquo;
Peggy demanded, as she bumped into Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; chimed in Florence,
crowding up behind Peggy and trying unsuccessfully
to look over their shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">THE CAVE FAMILY DISAPPEARS</span></h2>
<p>Jo Ann pointed to the rugged arched opening
before her. &ldquo;Look! The donkey&rsquo;s gone and
there&rsquo;s no sign of anyone. I don&rsquo;t believe that
family&rsquo;s here now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly all three girls walked on to the
cave and stood staring inside. With the rays
of the morning sun shining directly on the
entrance, they could easily see into the farthest
corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a soul here!&rdquo; finally ejaculated
Jo Ann. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone&mdash;bag and baggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s strange they&rsquo;d leave so suddenly,&rdquo;
put in Florence. &ldquo;They must&rsquo;ve left before daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>Peggy stepped inside the cave and kicked the
pile of ashes with her foot. &ldquo;There hasn&rsquo;t been
a fire here for hours&mdash;these ashes are as cold as
charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann sighed as she set the basket down on
the floor. &ldquo;Those poor little children won&rsquo;t get
any of this food, after all. Isn&rsquo;t that a shame?&rdquo;
She turned to Florence. &ldquo;Do you suppose our
coming here yesterday had anything to do with
their leaving so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;No, I hardly think
so. Now and then an Indian family spends the
night here when they&rsquo;re on their way farther up
the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they intended to leave so early, then why
were those two boys gathering wood yesterday?
They couldn&rsquo;t have burned all of it in such a
short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I was right, after all, about the blue-eyed
boy having been kidnaped,&rdquo; put in Peggy.</p>
<p>Silently the three girls stared around the cave,
each busy with her own thoughts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>A few minutes later Jo Ann reached down
and picked up the basket. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s see
if we can find which way they went. They
couldn&rsquo;t&rsquo;ve got very far with the old grandmother
and all those little children. Maybe we
can overtake them and give them these things&mdash;then
they&rsquo;ll know we want to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the damp earth of the narrow path they
could see distinctly the prints of bare feet and
the small half-moons made by the donkey. They
easily followed the trail till they came to the
rocky cart road up which they had ridden the
day before.</p>
<p>Here Jo Ann and Peggy dropped to their
knees and began examining the tracks in the
dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now which way do you suppose they went?&rdquo;
queried Jo Ann. &ldquo;These tracks could have been
made here yesterday by our donkeys and the
peon driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tracks seem to go in both directions, and
they&rsquo;re so indistinct it&rsquo;d be impossible to follow
a trail. You might as well give up, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Florence smiled over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;I believe
the blue-eyed Mexican boy is one mystery you
won&rsquo;t be able to solve. You&rsquo;ll have to use your
detective ability in finding out what became of
our milk and butter.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment,
then continued thoughtfully, &ldquo;If those people
followed this road up the mountain they&rsquo;d
pass within about fifty feet of our box at the
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;Oh, do you suppose
they really did get our things, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann jumped quickly to her feet. &ldquo;Well,
since they&rsquo;re gone, I hope they did get them.
Those little children need the milk and butter
much more than we do&mdash;only I hate to think of
their having stolen them.&rdquo; She glanced down
at the basket. &ldquo;I wish we could have given them
this food&mdash;they need it so badly. I wanted to see
that boy again, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do any good to stand here in the sun
talking about it,&rdquo; Florence called over to Peggy
and Jo Ann. &ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s drop the whole
business and go home&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost time to start
getting dinner, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mrs. Blackwell can help us explain
the mystery of their sudden departure,&rdquo; Jo Ann
remarked as she picked up the basket and started
off behind Florence, while Peggy brought up
the rear.</p>
<p>The three disappointed girls began slowly
climbing in single file up the steep, narrow,
winding path to the camp. Bending forward
like saplings blown by the wind, they trudged
silently up the trail, Jo Ann carrying the basket
on first one arm, then the other.</p>
<p>When they were within a short distance of the
top of the cliff Florence suddenly leaped backward,
gasping, &ldquo;Ugh! A snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bumped against Jo Ann with such force
that the basket was knocked from her hands and
rolled clattering down the mountain side. Unmindful
of the basket, Florence kept pushing
Jo Ann down the narrow trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>The next moment Jo Ann stumbled and half
fell against Peggy. Simultaneously a terrified
shriek rent the air. Jo Ann wheeled about in
time to see Peggy swaying dangerously over the
outer edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>With eyes dilated with horror she saw her
clutch wildly at a stunted tree growing out of
the rocky ledge. The next instant Jo Ann
reached out to grab Peggy. Her fingers touched
her skirt, but before she could grasp it, the tree
suddenly swayed outward over the cliff under
Peggy&rsquo;s weight.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Jo Ann shut her eyes tightly.
&ldquo;Oh, Peg&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo; she thought frantically.</p>
<p>The snapping of branches and the crashing of
rocks down the mountain side came to her ears.
Was Peg falling&mdash;falling&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>She forced her eyelids open. Thank goodness!
Peg was alive! Hanging to the tree. But oh, that
awful abyss she was hanging over! She must
help her out of that terrible plight if humanly
possible. The tree might pull out by the roots at
any moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Peg!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Jo Ann&rsquo;s great joy, Peggy began cautiously
inching her way along the bent tree
trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little nearer and I can reach you,&rdquo;
encouraged Jo Ann. She called over to Florence.
&ldquo;Grab hold of me and steady me while I pull
Peg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years&mdash;ages passed, it seemed to Jo Ann, as
she leaned forward with outstretched hands.
The instant Peggy&rsquo;s feet barely touched the
rocky ledge she reached down and pulled her
safely over the edge.</p>
<p>With tears rolling down her cheeks, Florence
threw her arms about Peggy. &ldquo;Oh, Peg, you
might&rsquo;ve been killed! And it was all my
fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;killed.&rdquo; Peggy took a step
backward and leaned against the bank for support.
&ldquo;I&mdash;feel&mdash;shaky, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; agreed Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wobbly-kneed,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;in the world&mdash;got into you girls&mdash;to
push that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a snake&mdash;a huge snake, right across our
path, and I almost stepped on it,&rdquo; answered
Florence. She cupped her hands to make a circle.
&ldquo;He was that big around. He was so long I
couldn&rsquo;t see either his head or his tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy uttered a little gasp of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re imagining things, Florence,&rdquo; put in
the practical Jo Ann. &ldquo;You know perfectly well
there&rsquo;re no snakes that big&mdash;except boa constrictors
in the jungles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was huge. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so
frightened by a smaller one. I&rsquo;ve never seen one
this large here before. He must be at least eight
or ten feet long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little twinkle entered Peggy&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You
girls ought to be even now. Jo insists a Mexican
boy has blue eyes, and you insist you saw a huge
boa constrictor right in sight of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that snake&rsquo;s still there&mdash;and I imagine it
is&mdash;I&rsquo;ll prove to you that I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Both Peggy and Jo Ann drew back slightly,
and Peggy spoke up. &ldquo;I, for one, am not going
back up this trail with any kind of snake&mdash;big
or little&mdash;waiting for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;re we ever going to get to the house,
then?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann. &ldquo;Will we have to go back
down to the cart road and walk all the way
around the mountain? Why, that&rsquo;s miles, and in
this hot sun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know a place where we can manage
to climb up the cliff,&rdquo; Florence told them.
&ldquo;How about it? Want to try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Jo Ann. &ldquo;&rsquo;Most anything&rsquo;d
be better than walking miles out of the way
when the house is only a few hundred yards
from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence led the way back down the trail a
short distance, then began climbing the sheer
surface of the cliff. By sticking their toes in the
crevices of the rock and catching hold of the
scraggly shrubs growing in the cracks, all three
finally reached the top of the cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>After they had walked along the ledge for a
short distance, Florence remarked, &ldquo;I think we
ought to be able to see the snake from here&mdash;if
it&rsquo;s still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously she pulled the bushes aside and
peered down on the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! There he is&mdash;right in the same place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy and Jo Ann leaned over to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that big black thing that looks like a
log?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann gasped, &ldquo;Gosh! What a snake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the biggest one I ever saw, except in
a zoo,&rdquo; declared Peggy, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Florence pointed to the snake. &ldquo;See those
bumps in him. He&rsquo;s probably had some squirrels
or rabbits for his dinner and is lying there
in the sun digesting them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t dream there were such snakes
around here,&rdquo; Jo Ann added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Before they started for the house, all three
girls picked up stones and pitched them down at
the snake. When one of the stones struck him,
the huge reptile slowly disappeared over the
edge of the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing you saw it in time,&rdquo; said
Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to have that terrible thing get
after me in a place like that, where I couldn&rsquo;t
run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they hastened across the mesa to the house,
Florence remarked, &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;d better not tell
Mother how big that snake was&mdash;she&rsquo;ll worry
every time we&rsquo;re out of sight, if we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Jo Ann and Peggy agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">FOOTPRINTS</span></h2>
<p>When the girls neared the house they were
surprised to hear several people talking in Spanish.
Perhaps the family from the cave have come
up the mountain by the cart road, Jo Ann
thought, and have stopped to talk to Mrs. Blackwell.
But a moment later a shadow of disappointment
crossed her face as she recognized the
woman and children from the goat ranch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment I thought it was those people
from the cave with the blue-eyed boy,&rdquo; Jo Ann
said in a low voice to Peggy.</p>
<p>Peggy shook her auburn head. &ldquo;Forget it, Jo.
There&rsquo;s no such luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The girls exchanged greetings in Spanish
with the visitors, then dropped down on the floor
beside the two little girls. Jo Ann, in her poor
Spanish, attempted to carry on a conversation
with the children, while Peggy looked on,
amused.</p>
<p>She was interrupted a few minutes later by
Mrs. Blackwell. &ldquo;Girls, Mar&iacute;a says a bear carried
off one of their pigs last night. Isn&rsquo;t that
too bad? They had them in an enclosure against
the cliff just back of the house here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann jumped quickly to her feet. &ldquo;I bet
that&rsquo;s what got our things at the spring. A bear!
Why didn&rsquo;t we think of that before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never been bothered with one before,&rdquo;
put in Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mar&iacute;a&rsquo;s husband, Juan, said the continued
drouth up in the mountains has caused the wild
animals to come down into the valley in search
of food,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell continued. &ldquo;The bear
had evidently followed the river, because they
found tracks up the ravine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mar&iacute;a, who had been watching the expression
on their faces intently, now began to shake
her head and to talk rapidly in Spanish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She says that bears like much the pork,&rdquo;
translated Florence for the girls&rsquo; benefit. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
afraid he&rsquo;ll come back for the rest of the pigs, and
she doesn&rsquo;t know what to do to keep him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to do!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;Why,
shoot him, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell smiled. &ldquo;I doubt if Juan has
ever owned a gun. About the only weapon the
peon ever uses is a stiletto, and it would not be
an easy matter to kill a bear with a stiletto&mdash;or
even with a machete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy shivered as if she were cold. &ldquo;I should
say it wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d hate to get that close to one,
especially a real wild bear! It gives me the
creeps to think about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a grand idea,&rdquo; burst out Jo Ann.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we go on a bear hunt? We have a
gun, and I can shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can shoot pretty good, too,&rdquo; added Peggy.
&ldquo;Daddy taught me when we lived in the country.
I killed a possum once when he got in our
henhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Jo Ann smiled. &ldquo;He probably just played possum
when he heard the report of your gun, and
you thought he was dead. They&rsquo;ll do that sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I killed him&mdash;sure enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s not like killing a bear&mdash;a real,
live, wild, grizzly bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have grizzly bears down here,
silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; retorted Jo
Ann. &ldquo;Grizzlies are found in the mountains of
North America, and this is North America,
isn&rsquo;t it? Besides, you haven&rsquo;t seen his tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the argument continued, Florence explained
to Mar&iacute;a and the children what it was
about. The two little girls stared wide eyed at
Jo Ann and Peggy. They had never in all their
lives heard of a girl&rsquo;s going out to hunt a bear.
They decided a gun must be one of those terrible
things which their grandmother had told them
about. A stick which shot forth a deadly fire that
killed everything before it. She had warned
them never to touch a fire stick and to hide if
they saw anyone with one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Peggy burst out just then with, &ldquo;Well, young
lady, you&rsquo;re not going on a bear hunt without
me, that&rsquo;s sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell stared at Jo Ann and Peggy
in horrified amazement. &ldquo;Girls! What are you
talking about? A bear hunt! The idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Blackwell, we wouldn&rsquo;t be in any
danger,&rdquo; protested Jo Ann. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d hide in a safe
place and watch for the bear; then, when he
came for another pig, we&rsquo;d shoot him&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, my dear, that it wouldn&rsquo;t be as
simple as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence, seeing the worried expression on
her mother&rsquo;s face, changed the subject. &ldquo;The
bear must&rsquo;ve smelled the bacon, and that&rsquo;s the
reason he found our box at the spring. By the
way, I wonder what time it is.&rdquo; She got up and
walked to the door. As she looked in at the clock
sitting on their improvised dressing table, she
gasped, &ldquo;Good gracious! I had no idea it was so
late. If we&rsquo;re going to have any dinner around
here today, I&rsquo;ll have to start the fire this very
minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>She went on through the house toward the
kitchen, Peggy and Jo Ann following a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll build the fire, Florence,&rdquo; offered Jo Ann,
taking the wood out of her hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it
burning before you and Peg get something ready
to cook on it&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll start it Mexican fashion,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure, Jo,&rdquo; teased Peggy. &ldquo;Suppose
there aren&rsquo;t any live coals left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Peggy and Florence disappeared into the
kitchen, and Jo Ann placed her armful of wood
down beside the outdoor fireplace. She stirred
the coals left from their breakfast fire then carefully
laid several small pieces of wood over
them. Leaning down, she began blowing on the
coals as she had seen the peon women do. Soon,
to her delight, tiny flames began licking at the
wood. She kept on blowing a few minutes
longer, then sat back on her heels to look with
satisfaction at the fire which was now burning
brightly in the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When in Mexico do as the Mexicans do,&rdquo;
she called gaily to Florence and Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
getting good. I beat you, and I didn&rsquo;t have to
use a match, either. Now bring on your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t beat us much. Here, put these
potatoes on to boil,&rdquo; Peggy replied as she
handed a pot of potatoes to Jo Ann. &ldquo;I used the
last of the water over them. Hadn&rsquo;t I better get
some more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann stopped in the act of setting the pot
of potatoes over the fire as a thought suddenly
flashed into her mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the water,&rdquo; she
offered quickly. She put the pot down and hurried
to the kitchen for the bucket. A moment
later she disappeared down the path to the
spring.</p>
<p>Jo must be up to something, thought Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>When Jo Ann reached the spring, she set the
bucket down on a rock and stood gazing at the
overturned box which they had so proudly
called their refrigerator the night before. If a
real live bear had been the thief, then what had
he done with the jars of milk and butter? she
asked herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see if I can find a
clue. There ought to be tracks somewhere
around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began looking among the ferns and rocks
along the bank of the river beyond the spring
in search of some sign of the marauder. Carefully
she examined every track. Here were their
own tracks made the night before, and the tiny
footprints of a squirrel, but not a sign of big
padded footprints made by a large, heavy animal.</p>
<p>Still unwilling to give up, she jumped from
stone to stone across the swiftly flowing stream,
and began searching the opposite bank. A moment
later, with a cry of satisfaction, she
dropped to her knees and began examining some
huge tracks in the soft earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bear, all right!&rdquo; she exclaimed out
loud. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where he crossed the river&mdash;but,
gee, what a big one!&rdquo; Instinctively she glanced
all around as though expecting to see the bear.
&ldquo;I bet he smelled our bacon and crossed right
here.&rdquo; She began slowly jumping back over the
stones, watching for any sign left by the recent
thief.</p>
<p>When in midstream she caught a glimpse of
a familiar-looking object a short distance ahead.
So suddenly did she stop that she lost her balance
and toppled off into the swiftly rushing
stream.</p>
<p>Gasping from her sudden plunge into the icy
water, she scrambled back up on the rock.
&ldquo;Gosh, that water&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo; she shivered. &ldquo;But
since I&rsquo;m already wet I might as well go on and
see if my eyes are deceiving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the water foaming about her knees, she
carefully picked her way down the stream to a
large boulder hidden under an overhanging tree.
Then, reaching down, she picked up the object
that had been wedged between the boulder and
the bank.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; she said to herself.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our jar of butter. It won&rsquo;t do anyone
any good because the jar&rsquo;s broken and there
might be glass in the butter, but at least I have
proof now that those people at the cave didn&rsquo;t
steal our things&mdash;I can show Florence and Peg
the bear tracks, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hastened back up the stream to the spring,
and forgetting the bucket of water she had come
after, ran on to the house. So eager was she to
tell the girls of her discovery that she did not
notice that her wet skirt was flapping about her
legs and the water sloshing in her shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jo, what in the world&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;
began Peggy as she saw the bedraggled figure
running toward her. &ldquo;Did you see the bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I found his tracks! And look what
else I found!&rdquo; she held up the broken jar, partly
filled with butter. &ldquo;I told you those people at the
cave didn&rsquo;t get our things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>On hearing the noise, Florence ran from the
kitchen. &ldquo;What on earth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then
saw what Jo Ann was holding in her hand.
&ldquo;Where did you find that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jo Ann was explaining the details of
her discovery, they heard a slight noise behind
them and, turning, saw Mrs. Blackwell standing
in the doorway. &ldquo;I heard all this chatter and
had to find out what it was about. You&rsquo;re a real
Sherlock, I see, Jo&mdash;you&rsquo;ve solved the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; beamed Jo Ann, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve proved that
I was right about the people at the cave not
stealing our things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had talked a few minutes longer,
Florence asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do with the bucket
of water, Jo? I want to make Mother&rsquo;s tea, so
we can have dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann stared in blank amazement a moment,
then said sheepishly, &ldquo;I forgot it. I was so excited
about my discovery that I forgot all about
it. I&rsquo;ll bring it in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>She was off like a shot and a few minutes later
returned with the bucket of water. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
I kept dinner waiting so long,&rdquo; she told them,
as she set the bucket on the table, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m glad
I&rsquo;ve solved that mystery. I&rsquo;m going to solve the
other one, too, before I stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy grinned mischievously. &ldquo;Which mystery
do you mean, Jo? The disappearance of
those people at the cave or the mystery of the
blue-eyed boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both. Just give me time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; Florence called shortly
afterwards as she came from the kitchen with a
pot of tea, which she placed on the table beside
her mother&rsquo;s plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be there in a minute,&rdquo; called back Jo Ann.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m simply starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a plain little print dress out of her
bag, then jerked off her wet clothes. &ldquo;Can I&mdash;may
I&mdash;eat barefooted?&rdquo; she asked in a muffled
voice as she pulled the dress over her head.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take too long to put on shoes and stockings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When in Mexico do as the peons do,&rdquo; quoted
Peggy, laughing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your motto, is it?
You&rsquo;ll probably want to use the floor for your
table and your fingers for knives and forks,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I haven&rsquo;t any <i>tortillas</i> to use for knife
and fork as they do. Only my feet are peon, anyway,
and you can&rsquo;t see them under the table.&rdquo; Jo
Ann slipped quickly into her place at the table
where the others were already seated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell laughed gaily. &ldquo;You girls are
as good as a tonic,&rdquo; she declared a little later. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t laughed so much for months. I feel
much stronger today, too. I think I&rsquo;ll take a
short walk later on when it gets cooler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence beamed as she leaned over and
squeezed her mother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d get
well up here. I&rsquo;m going to write Daddy this very
afternoon and tell him what a good patient you
are and how much better you look already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that right after dinner,&rdquo; put in
Jo Ann. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to wash the dishes to make
up for running away and leaving you and Peg
to get dinner alone. I promise to be good after
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean till next time,&rdquo; laughed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course, when there&rsquo;s something important&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
began Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand, Jo,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Blackwell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT</span></h2>
<p>As soon as they had finished eating and the
girls had stacked the dishes and carried them
to the kitchen, Jo Ann turned to Florence. &ldquo;Now
get out of here, young lady. I told you I was going
to wash the dishes. You go and write that
letter to your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught Florence by the shoulders and
playfully pushed her out of the kitchen and
across the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peg, I might let you wipe the dishes if you&rsquo;ll
promise to be good,&rdquo; she told her as she returned
to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s really quite considerate of you, my
dear,&rdquo; smilingly retorted Peggy. &ldquo;I appreciate
the honor very much.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Gay chatter accompanied the rattle and clatter
of dishes as the two girls made quick work
of their dishwashing. As they worked, their conversation
drifted back to the subject of the bear
and the pigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine living out in a wild, lonesome
place like this and not owning a gun, can
you, Peg?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann. Without waiting for
an answer she went on: &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be a shame to let
that old bear come back and get the rest of those
pigs when we have a gun and know how to shoot
it. I&rsquo;m going down there this afternoon and look
the place over. If I can find a ledge or some
place where I can be practically out of danger,
I&rsquo;m going to give Mr. Bear a warmer reception
than he&rsquo;s looking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very keen about a bear hunt myself,
but if you go, I&rsquo;m going with you. I have my
doubts about Mrs. Blackwell&rsquo;s letting us go,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Jo Ann let her hands lie idly in the soapy
dishwater while she pondered over how to meet
Mrs. Blackwell&rsquo;s objections. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she
said finally, &ldquo;if she would be willing to let us
go if we get Mar&iacute;a&rsquo;s husband&mdash;Juan&mdash;to go
with us. I believe she would. I heard her say
that she thought Juan was one of the most dependable,
trustworthy peons she ever knew.
We&rsquo;d be safe enough if he&rsquo;d go with us, because
he&rsquo;d have his dagger&mdash;stiletto, I believe it&rsquo;s
called. The Mexicans&rsquo;re mighty keen and quick
about using them, I&rsquo;ve heard. Of course, no one&rsquo;s
planning to get at such close quarters with a
bear, but if worst came to worst&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention such a thing,&rdquo; protested
Peggy. &ldquo;It scares me just to think about it. I&rsquo;d
run for the nearest tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would! Don&rsquo;t you know that&rsquo;s the worst
thing you could do? Never turn your back on a
bear. He&rsquo;s not likely to attack you, if you hold
your ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you think I&rsquo;m going to stand perfectly
still and let Mr. Bear look me over and
decide whether he likes nice juicy white meat as
his diet, you&rsquo;re mistaken. Nothing doing, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. I&rsquo;d shoot him before he got
near you, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose you missed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit talking such foolishness and wipe the
rest of those dishes. Let&rsquo;s hurry and finish in a
jiffy and go on down to the enclosure where they
have the pigs and look about for the safest spot
in which to wait for Mr. Bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose it won&rsquo;t do any harm to go
down and look, but I believe Mrs. Blackwell
won&rsquo;t let&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a wet blanket, Peg. I&rsquo;m going to ask
her right now, and you&rsquo;ll soon see that she will.&rdquo;
Jo Ann hastily took her hands out of the dishwater,
dried them, and then went over to the
door of the bedroom. In another moment she
came back. &ldquo;Mrs. Blackwell&rsquo;s asleep, so I&rsquo;ll
have to wait to ask her. Florence is sound asleep
too. I&rsquo;m sure Mrs. Blackwell wouldn&rsquo;t object to
our going down now just to look at the enclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where it is?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly, but I think I can find it. We&rsquo;ll
follow the path down toward the goat ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They finished the dishes and put the kitchen
in order, then slipped quietly around to the back
of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the path, Peg. Follow me.&rdquo; Jo Ann
led the way down the path she and Florence had
taken the afternoon before.</p>
<p>As they neared the goat ranch Jo Ann began
looking for some sign which might lead them
to the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be up this way somewhere,&rdquo; Jo
Ann said finally. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s follow this ravine a little
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose we get lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can turn around and go back, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed a narrow path leading into
the cool, shady depths of a deep ravine, a
rugged, precipitous wall towering on their right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beau-ti-ful place,&rdquo; breathed Peggy,
a few minutes later, as they stopped to rest and
cool off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! Doesn&rsquo;t that sound to you like the
roar of water?&rdquo; asked Jo Ann. &ldquo;The river must
not be far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls listened a moment. &ldquo;It surely does,&rdquo;
agreed Peggy, &ldquo;but how could that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must&rsquo;ve gone around in a circle and&rsquo;ll
come out not far from our spring. Come on, let&rsquo;s
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started eagerly up the steep narrow
path. A moment later they were startled by the
sound of a shrill squeal above the roar of the
river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do you suppose the bear&rsquo;s after another
pig?&rdquo; whispered Peggy, grabbing Jo Ann by the
arm. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I wish I&rsquo;d brought the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back,&rdquo; begged Peggy, but Jo Ann
shook her head. &ldquo;Wait a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened intently a moment, then, to their
relief, the squeals changed to contented grunts.</p>
<p>Jo Ann laughed. &ldquo;Juan must be feeding the
pigs, but it did frighten me for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>A moment later they came in sight of a crude
enclosure built against the overhanging wall of
the cliff. Tall poles were lashed together around
a recess in the wall, making a small circular pen.
The next moment they spied Juan working at
strengthening a weak place in the wall. It appeared
impenetrable, as it was, to them, and they
wondered that any animal, even one as large as a
bear, could break through such a barricade.</p>
<p>Juan turned from his work as he saw the girls
approaching. After the customary salutation he
went on in Spanish. &ldquo;The bear very bad&mdash;very
ferocious. He like much the pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded her head. &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>&mdash;but why
can&rsquo;t we shoot him? I&rsquo;ll kill him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan shook his head and looked puzzled, and
Jo Ann realized he had not understood a word
she had said.</p>
<p>She racked her brain for a way to make her
meaning clear to him. Finally she picked up a
stick and, after pointing to herself, put it to her
shoulder and pretended to pull a trigger.
&ldquo;Pling! See! <i>El oso muerto</i> [The bear dead].&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Juan smiled approval; then, jabbering rapidly,
he pointed to himself and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not you,&rdquo; Jo Ann tried again, motioning
to herself. &ldquo;Me! See&mdash;I&rsquo;ll shoot him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, after several attempts, she succeeded
in making him understand.</p>
<p>But Juan shook his head. &ldquo;The Se&ntilde;ora no
like,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Jo Ann, &ldquo;but if you come
with Peg and me&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to each of them&mdash;&ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while Peggy enjoyed watching the pantomime,
interrupted now and then with a few
English and Spanish words. Never before had
she seen anyone go to so much trouble to make
herself understood. Jo Ann certainly was a determined
person.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>After a little, however, Peggy became restless
and began gathering some of the dainty little
ferns growing at the base of the cliff. She wandered
over to the bank of the mountain stream
and stood for a few moments watching the
water as it rushed and tumbled down the rocky
gorge. Then her thoughts drifted back to the
bear. She wondered if he could be hiding somewhere
near, waiting for a chance to steal another
pig.</p>
<p>She glanced nervously about, then called over
to Jo Ann, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ready to go? They&rsquo;ll be
wondering what&rsquo;s become of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; Jo Ann called back.
&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s all set for the surprise party tonight.
See that ledge up there?&rdquo; She pointed to
a narrow ledge about fifteen feet straight up the
side of the cliff. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you and I are
going to wait for Mr. Bear. We couldn&rsquo;t be in
any danger there&mdash;unless you got scared and
tumbled off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;re we going to get up there?&rdquo;
Peggy asked quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bird or a lizard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. Juan&rsquo;s going to cut notches in a
pole for us to climb up on,&rdquo; explained Jo Ann.
&ldquo;But come on, I&rsquo;ve got lots to do to get ready
for tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and called to Juan, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head vigorously to reassure
her, and then she and Peggy started down the
path for home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth have you girls been?&rdquo; Florence
called to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exploring,&rdquo; Jo Ann called back.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the porch Jo Ann began
talking as rapidly as her tongue could fly,
explaining about Juan&rsquo;s consent to help them on
their bear hunt, the ledge above the enclosure
where they could wait in safety, and the other
details of her plans. She ended with a vigorous
appeal to Mrs. Blackwell: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll let us go,
won&rsquo;t you, now that Juan&rsquo;s consented to go with
us and that we&rsquo;ll be in no danger? We&rsquo;ve got to
help Juan kill that bear before he gets the rest
of the pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell was silent for several moments
before answering. After what seemed to
Jo Ann to be an age, she said slowly, &ldquo;If Juan&rsquo;ll
be with you&mdash;and if you&rsquo;ll promise not to take
any unnecessary risks, I&rsquo;ll let you two go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Blackwell. That&rsquo;s
grand!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that Jo Ann doesn&rsquo;t do anything
rash,&rdquo; put in Peggy.</p>
<p>Florence smiled over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;Maybe you
won&rsquo;t be so enthusiastic by the time that bear
hugs you. I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m going to stay here with
Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann merely smiled back at Florence and
caught Peggy by the arm. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s go in
and get our things ready for the hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls went on into the house, and Jo
Ann quickly opened her bag and took out several
garments and handed them to Peggy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need these knickers. We can&rsquo;t be bothered
with skirts flapping about our legs tonight,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we surely can&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d be a terrible
nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get the flashlight, and I&rsquo;ll get the gun. This
is a peach of a gun,&rdquo; Jo Ann added a moment
later, running her hand lovingly over the polished
surface of the stock. &ldquo;I wish it were mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Is it different from any other gun?&rdquo;
Peggy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different! I should say it is. It&rsquo;s two guns in
one, a double-barrel shotgun and a 30-30 rifle.
This little barrel underneath is the rifle barrel.&rdquo;
She opened a box and held it out to Peggy. &ldquo;See
what vicious-looking cartridges you shoot in it.
They&rsquo;ll blow a hole clear through that bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s eyes opened wide in surprise. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never seen a gun like that before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have, either. They&rsquo;re very expensive.
Florence said her father ordered this one so he
wouldn&rsquo;t have to carry two guns when he went
hunting. You see, in the mountains you never
know whether you&rsquo;ll run into wild turkeys or
mountain lions, and with this gun you&rsquo;re ready
for anything. I want to get started as early as
possible tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>They hurried outdoors, built the fire and began
preparations for supper.</p>
<p>Later that evening, after the supper things
were cleared away, they sat out under the stars,
watching a full round moon rise from behind
the mountain range across the valley. As it
rose higher and higher the shadows began to
disappear, and soon it was almost as light as
day.</p>
<p>Jo Ann was very thankful for the bright
moonlight. It made their daring adventure seem
a little less dangerous. Now that it was so light
she decided it was time to leave. She sprang up,
saying, &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s light enough for us to see
now, Peg. Come on; let&rsquo;s change our clothes and
get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few more minutes two knicker-clad figures
disappeared down the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>When they neared the deep gorge which had
looked so beautiful to them that afternoon, the
girls began to feel a little nervous. They peered
at every shadow, almost expecting it to rush
at them. Jo Ann held the gun ready to throw it
into position in a second. She had the safety on,
but the gun was loaded, ready to use. Peggy
stayed as close behind her as she possibly could
without getting in her way.</p>
<p>When they saw Juan coming to meet them
they breathed a sigh of relief. He wore the usual
white trousers and loose white shirt of the peon,
and they made him look like a ghost walking in
the moonlight. But Jo Ann and Peggy were not
afraid of ghosts just now. They were looking for
something big and black and terrifying.</p>
<p>Jo Ann started to speak, but Juan motioned
to her to be quiet. He led them to the base of the
cliff, then pointed to the crude notched pole
which he had placed against the ledge.</p>
<p>A few minutes later both girls had climbed
up the narrow rocky ledge and were wriggling
about trying to find a comfortable position.
Statue-like Juan took his place just below. Jo
Ann held the gun across her lap, ready to throw
it into position in an instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>The moonlight, filtering through the trees,
cast grotesque shadows on the ground below
them. Several times Jo Ann was sure she saw a
dark hulk shambling toward the enclosure, only
to discover it was the shadow of a tree swaying
in the night breeze. She strained her eyes till
they hurt, trying to peer into the dark depths of
the ravine from which they expected the bear
to appear.</p>
<p>In the excitement of making plans for the
bear hunt, Jo Ann had forgotten about the blue-eyed
boy, but now her mind drifted back to him
and the mysterious way in which he and the rest
of the family had disappeared. It was almost as
though the earth had opened and swallowed
them, she thought. She went over the events of
the last two days in her mind and tried to plan
some course of action. She did not intend to
leave one stone unturned that might help in solving
the mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>While she sat there dreaming, she was startled
by a tiny stone hitting her on the arm. She
glanced around quickly and saw Peggy pointing
questioningly to the high range of mountains on
their right. With difficulty Jo Ann turned partly
around on the ledge. A tiny light flickering
against the blackness of the mountains caught
and held her attention. For a moment she
thought it was a star falling; then she noticed
that it did not move. What could it be? She
looked at Peggy and shook her head to indicate
that she did not know what it was.</p>
<p>For a while they watched the light. There
was something mysterious about the way it flared
up brightly then almost flickered out, only to
brighten up again. That could not be a campfire,
she decided. Florence had said no one lived
up on the side of that mountain. It was too wild
for habitation. At that distance a tiny campfire
could scarcely be seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly a thought flashed through her mind.
It was a signal light. Someone was trying to send
a message across the valley. Perhaps the blue-eyed
boy <i>had</i> been kidnaped, after all, and that
was why the family had disappeared so suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>She turned to tell this to Peggy, then realized
she must not talk. The next instant she was half
ashamed for being so suspicious. If that boy had
been kidnaped, she felt sure those people had
not done it&mdash;they were merely tools in the employ
of someone else, she decided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE CHARCOAL MAKER</span></h2>
<p>Peggy and Jo Ann continued to wait silently
for the stealthy appearance of the bear. Myriads
of tiny stars winked down at them as they
watched the full round moon sail slowly across
the deep sapphire sky. Now and then the chirp
of a near-by cricket or the croak of a frog could
be heard above the constant splashing of the
river.</p>
<p>In their hasty preparations for the bear hunt
they had forgotten their sweaters, and now they
shivered a little, both from excitement and the
chill mountain air. The jagged edges of the rock
felt anything but comfortable, and their muscles
ached from sitting in one position so long. Jo
Ann felt dizzy from trying to watch the light
high on the mountain side and the dark shadows
below her at one and the same time. Was there
some connection between this new mystery and
the mystery of the blue-eyed boy? she wondered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>When the girls felt they could keep still no
longer, Juan stepped out from the shadows and
called up to them in Spanish, &ldquo;The bear no
come tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think
he&rsquo;s coming either. Come on, Peg,&rdquo; she said,
turning around on the ledge. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get down
and stretch our legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stiffly the two girls scrambled down the pole
and began kicking and stretching in an effort to
relax their cramped muscles.</p>
<p>Juan began jabbering rapidly in Spanish, and
Jo Ann stopped a moment to listen. &ldquo;The bear
no have <i>hambre</i> tonight,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>She gazed at him questioningly. &ldquo;<i>Hombre?</i>
Man?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;<i>No sabe</i> [I do not understand].&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Juan shook his head and began rubbing his
hand over his stomach. &ldquo;No&mdash;no <i>hombre</i>,
<i>h-ambre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s face broke into a smile, &ldquo;Ah, <i>s&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; she
replied, then turning to Peggy she explained:
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to tell us that the bear isn&rsquo;t hungry
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Peggy. &ldquo;Anyway,
I&rsquo;ve had enough. I&rsquo;m going to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started off but had only gone a few steps
when she realized Jo Ann was not following.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming, Jo?&rdquo; she called to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a minute. I want to ask Juan about
that light.&rdquo; Pointing to the light, she asked,
&ldquo;What is it, Juan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that. It is the light of a <i>carbonero</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is a <i>carbonero</i>?&rdquo; she asked again.</p>
<p>Juan rattled off more Spanish, but Jo Ann
shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ll ask Florence,&rdquo; she said to herself,
then turned to follow Peggy. &ldquo;<i>Buenas
noches</i>, Juan,&rdquo; she called back to him. &ldquo;Tomorrow
night we watch again, <i>sabe</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Juan nodded his head, &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls hurried back to the house, and
on entering they found Florence and her mother
fast asleep. They quickly slipped into their
pajamas and snuggled up under the warm
blankets. Peggy, worn out from their long vigil,
soon fell asleep, but Jo Ann kept wondering
about the light. Why was it there? And why
did it flare up and die down as it had? The more
she thought about it, the more convinced she became
that it had something to do with the blue-eyed
boy. She would climb the mountain the
next day and find the answer to these questions,
she decided. If that really was a signal light, she
was going to find out what it was all about. Finally,
when the faint rose of dawn was beginning to
show in the east, Jo Ann drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that she had scarcely closed
her eyes when she was conscious of someone calling,
&ldquo;Jo, Jo, wake up. If you want any breakfast
you&rsquo;ll have to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>There was a strong aroma of coffee and the
clatter of dishes being placed on the table. Jo
Ann opened her eyes and stared around in surprise
as she saw Peggy putting the finishing
touches to the breakfast table and Florence helping
her mother to her chair.</p>
<p>She sprang quickly out of bed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t
you wake me sooner? I didn&rsquo;t mean to sleep so
late. I don&rsquo;t know what made me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly. The events of the night
before flashed through her mind: the bear hunt,
the mysterious light, the trip of investigation she
had planned up the mountain. If she were to
accomplish all she wanted to do today, she had
no time to waste.</p>
<p>After a brief sketchy toilet, she slipped into
her place at the table and began eating rapidly,
scarcely conscious of the food she was putting
into her mouth. In spite of Peggy&rsquo;s and Florence&rsquo;s
pointed remarks, she ate in unruffled silence,
her mind apparently a million miles
away. &ldquo;Jo&rsquo;s on the trail of another mystery,&rdquo;
Peggy laughingly remarked to Florence and
Mrs. Blackwell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>Just then Jo Ann looked up and asked, &ldquo;What
does <i>carbonero</i> mean, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A maker of charcoal.&rdquo; Florence smiled. &ldquo;I
know why you&rsquo;re asking that question. Peggy
told me all about your mysterious light and how
you killed the big bad bear.&rdquo; She laughed teasingly,
then added, &ldquo;That light was just from a
charcoal maker&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo; Jo Ann felt a wave of
disappointment sweep over her. She had been so
sure there was some mystery about the light and
that it would lead her to the blue-eyed boy, and
now Florence said it was only the light of a
charcoal maker&rsquo;s fire. &ldquo;Every now and then an
Indian family will go up in the mountains and
stay there several days to make charcoal; then
they carry it to the villages to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At these words a sudden new idea leaped into
Jo Ann&rsquo;s mind. It was so simple that she wondered
why she hadn&rsquo;t thought of it before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, I believe I&rsquo;ve solved the mystery!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;That Mexican family of the cave
have gone up there on the mountain to make
charcoal. I&rsquo;m on their trail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but that you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
agreed Florence. &ldquo;That would explain why
those two boys were gathering wood the other
afternoon. They were going to use it to make
charcoal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann burst out impulsively, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up
there on the mountain and see if that really is
our family of the cave. Who wants to go with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re probably going on a wild-goose
chase, but I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Florence replied.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll not be any easy matter to locate the
family, even if we can see the smoke from their
fire.&rdquo; She turned to her mother, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t object,
do you, if we go up there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell hesitated a moment, then answered,
&ldquo;Oh, I think it&rsquo;ll be all right for you
to go if you&rsquo;ll be very careful and be back before
dark.&rdquo; She smiled over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;I know
you&rsquo;ll never be satisfied till you find out if your
blue-eyed boy&rsquo;s up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take us long,&rdquo; Jo Ann said confidently.
&ldquo;That light didn&rsquo;t look as if it were very
far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence and her mother exchanged amused
glances, and then Florence remarked, &ldquo;We&rsquo;d
better take some lunch with us. It&rsquo;s lots farther
than you think, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going,&rdquo; spoke up Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to stay here with Mrs. Blackwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann sprang up from the table. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
get busy this minute and get our work done and
get started.&rdquo; She began stacking the dishes hurriedly.</p>
<p>A few minutes later she was washing the
dishes so vigorously that Florence prophesied
there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough left unbroken to set
the table for supper. In a surprisingly short time
they had finished the dishes, packed the lunch,
and were ready to start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll carry the gun along,&rdquo; Jo Ann
remarked. &ldquo;We might see a rabbit or squirrel&mdash;or
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the two girls were winding their way
up a donkey trail that led up the mountain side.
From the very first they kept stopping now and
then to scan the mountain for the smoke from
the charcoal maker&rsquo;s fire.</p>
<p>Finally Jo Ann cried triumphantly, &ldquo;I see it!
Look, right up there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls began searching for a path leading
toward the spiral of smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know they couldn&rsquo;t have climbed up this
steep place,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d have
had to be human flies to do that. That old
grandmother and the little children couldn&rsquo;t
possibly have made it up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the only thing to do is to follow this
trail a little farther and see if we can&rsquo;t find some
trace of the way they did go.&rdquo; Florence started
along the path, Jo Ann close at her heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth made them go to such an outlandish
place to make their charcoal, Florence?
It looks as if they could&rsquo;ve found a much better
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, the Indian has no way to cut
his wood except with a machete&mdash;that&rsquo;s just a
big, long butcher knife. He hunts for the fallen
limbs and trees that don&rsquo;t require much chopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, if I were a charcoal maker, I&rsquo;d
hunt an easier place to reach than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had walked for some distance
without noticing any sign of another path leading
up the mountain, Jo Ann called, &ldquo;Say, I believe
we&rsquo;ve gone too far. We must&rsquo;ve missed
their path. That smoke&rsquo;s back of us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. So it is. We&rsquo;ll have to turn
around and go back. If we don&rsquo;t find that path
soon, I think we&rsquo;d better go back home. The sun
is terrifically hot now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began retracing their steps, searching
more carefully than before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That family would&rsquo;ve been bound to leave
some sort of a trail,&rdquo; Jo Ann kept saying.</p>
<p>When at last they reached the spot where they
had first seen the smoke, Florence said in a discouraged
tone, &ldquo;How about giving it up and going
back home now? I&rsquo;m tired and hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Jo Ann urged as she wiped the
perspiration from her forehead. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit down
in the shade of this cliff and rest for a while, and
then we&rsquo;ll feel more like going on.&rdquo; She
dropped down on the ground and leaned back
against the cool rock.</p>
<p>Wearily Florence followed her example and
began fanning herself with her hat.</p>
<p>After she had rested a few minutes, Jo Ann
rose, saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take another look
around here while you rest awhile longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wandered down the trail a short distance
beyond the cliff, searching for a place where it
would be possible to climb up the mountain
side. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t find their path, then I&rsquo;m going
to find another way to get up there,&rdquo; she
told herself determinedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>A few minutes later she started up the steep
bank, steadying herself now and then by catching
hold of the scrubby bushes growing out of
the crevices of the rocks. After climbing about
twenty-five or thirty feet she found herself on a
rocky ledge above the cliff.</p>
<p>Her eyes suddenly began to twinkle. &ldquo;I believe
I&rsquo;ll slip around this ledge till I&rsquo;m right
above Florence and drop a pebble or two on her,
just for fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she was slipping quietly along the ledge
she heard a faint moaning sound. She stopped
instantly and listened. &ldquo;What on earth is that?
Sounds like someone in distress. Just suppose it&rsquo;s
a wild animal!&rdquo; She strained her ears again to
listen. Once more the moaning sound floated
down to her a little more distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a human being!&rdquo; she told herself excitedly.
&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s more than one person.
Sounds as if there must be several in distress. I
wonder if it could be that family from the cave
in some kind of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>She leaned over the edge of the cliff and
called down excitedly, &ldquo;Florence! Oh, Florence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; Florence called back in a
surprised voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right over you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence stepped out hastily and stared up at
Jo Ann. &ldquo;How did you ever manage to get&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear that queer moaning sound a
minute ago?&rdquo; Jo Ann broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe someone&rsquo;s in terrible trouble. Come
on up here and let&rsquo;s see if we can find them. Be
sure to bring the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get up there?&rdquo; Florence asked
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down the trail a little way, and I&rsquo;ll show
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes Jo Ann was helping to pull
Florence up the bank. No sooner had she
reached the ledge than Jo Ann ejaculated,
&ldquo;Listen! There&rsquo;s that sound again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s eyes stretched to their widest as the
cry of distress reached her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy! That&rsquo;s awful,&rdquo; she murmured, low
voiced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sound&rsquo;s coming from right up there!&rdquo;
Jo Ann pointed almost straight above. &ldquo;Come
on, I believe we can get up around this way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">FRIENDS AT LAST</span></h2>
<p>Jo Ann started climbing the steep bank,
Florence following as closely as possible. After
they had struggled upward a short distance, Jo
Ann caught sight of a faintly marked trail
which showed signs of having been used recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the way they went!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the right track at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right, because it seems to be
winding up toward that smoke,&rdquo; Florence
agreed.</p>
<p>Just as she had finished speaking the moaning
sounded again, more clearly than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo; cried Jo Ann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>After starting up the faintly marked path, the
girls were able to make much better time. Without
wasting a moment in conversation they
hurried on as fast as they could go. A few minutes
later at a turn in the path they came in
sight of a crude shelter of boughs thrown up in
a hurried fashion against the steep face of
rock.</p>
<p>Simultaneously the piteous wailing of several
voices burst upon their ears with such heart-rending
sadness that involuntarily both girls
were filled with sympathy.</p>
<p>The next moment, through an open space in
the shelter, Jo Ann saw the white-clad figure of
a boy stretched out on the floor. Huddled
around him were two women and several little
girls, their heads bowed and their faces almost
concealed by their black <i>rebosas</i>.</p>
<p>Catching Florence by the hand, Jo Ann
quickly led her to the entrance of the shack. As
they stepped inside, the mourners raised startled
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Immediately the two girls recognized the two
women as the mother and grandmother they
had seen in the cave. Swiftly then Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes
flew to the still, white-clad figure lying on a mat
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; flashed through her mind as she
dropped on her knees and placed a comforting
hand on the mother&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Before she could think of a single Spanish
word of sympathy, the poor mother began wailing,
&ldquo;<i>A Dios!</i> My son&mdash;my Pepito! He is
dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over and over she intoned this lament, along
with the groaning of the grandmother and the
little girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could that boy have died so suddenly?&rdquo;
Jo Ann thought. &ldquo;He looked frail and undernourished,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Her train of thought was broken by hearing
Florence begin questioning the mother. She listened
intently to see if she could discover what
they were saying. She could catch only a few
words now and then, but she understood the
mother to say that the boy had died that morning.
He and the other boy had gone higher up
on the mountain the night before to help the
father to gather the wood and start the fire for
making the charcoal. The boy had taken sick
suddenly&mdash;the father had brought him down
and he had died soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Before the mother had finished speaking, Jo
Ann saw Florence kneel down beside the still
figure of the boy and feel first his pulse then
touch his forehead and cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; Jo Ann thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead&mdash;why
is she doing that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Florence exclaimed, &ldquo;Jo,
find me a piece of glass this instant! Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth does she want a piece of
glass?&rdquo; Jo Ann thought, but without stopping
to question she began looking about the scantily
furnished hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sign of any kind of glass here.
Won&rsquo;t this do instead?&rdquo; she asked a moment
later as she handed her a small glazed pottery
mug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to do. Break it&mdash;I want only a
small piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jo Ann checked the question
at the end of her tongue and quickly broke the
mug against the stone <i>metate</i>, then handed her
one of the pieces.</p>
<p>Wide eyed, she watched Florence place the
piece of pottery, glazed side down, over the boy&rsquo;s
mouth. After a short interval she saw her take it
up and examine it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jo! There&rsquo;s a tiny speck of moisture
on this! Don&rsquo;t you see it?&rdquo; Florence exclaimed
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means he&rsquo;s not dead! There&rsquo;s a fighting
chance for him yet.&rdquo; She turned and repeated
this to the mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try artificial respiration,&rdquo; Jo Ann put
in excitedly. &ldquo;I know how! I can help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Florence nodded assent as she began lifting
the thin little arms up and down, being careful
to press them against his sides each time. While
she was doing this, the mother and grandmother
were mumbling their prayers, the tears rolling
down their cheeks.</p>
<p>After Florence had worked for several minutes,
she heard sudden footsteps back of her,
then a deep voice demanding, &ldquo;What are you
doing? My son is dead. Why are you disturbing
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned about quickly and saw a dark,
grimy, bearded man and behind him the blue-eyed
boy. With a gesture to Jo Ann to continue
the artificial respiration, Florence rose and
began explaining why she thought the boy was
alive. She picked up the piece of pottery, saying,
&ldquo;Look! I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she was placing it over the boy&rsquo;s
mouth, she noticed a tiny flickering of his eyelids.
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly, pointing to
his eyelids. &ldquo;He <i>is</i> alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of mingled joy and awe came over the
man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;<i>Madre de Dios!</i> My son lives!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;You are an angel of mercy. You have
brought him back to life!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, Pap&aacute;!</i> They have performed a miracle!&rdquo;
the mother agreed, smiling through her tears.</p>
<p>Florence placed her hand over his heart, then
she looked up at the parents, saying, &ldquo;His heart
very bad. It is necessary that you take him down
from here immediately. It is too high up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si&mdash;s&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita. Whatever you say I will
do,&rdquo; the father said.</p>
<p>Florence and Jo Ann lifted the boy gently
and placed him, head lowered slightly, over his
father&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>As he began to shift the child into a more
upright position, Florence spoke up quickly,
&ldquo;No, no&mdash;you carry him like this, and the blood
will run to his head&mdash;then he will get better
more quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien</i>,&rdquo; the father assented, and started down
the path at the easy rhythmical pace of the
peon, Florence and Jo Ann following closely.</p>
<p>When they had gone a short distance, the
mother caught up with them. &ldquo;I come with my
Pepito,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Florence, what made you think that boy
might not be dead?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked a moment
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy has told me of several cases like that
one. Some people, he said, could not stand the
high altitude. That boy was frail and undernourished
to begin with, and I figured that the
hard work and the high altitude combined were
too much for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to think of putting
that piece of pottery over his mouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s a law in this country that requires
a corpse to be buried within a few hours
after death. Daddy told me that several times he
has used a piece of glass in this way to prove to
the officials that a patient was not really dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessing you knew about that. I&rsquo;ve
never seen people more helpless in my life than
those poor peons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy says most peons know nothing of
modern medicine and are ignorant of some of
the simplest remedies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>By this time they had reached a cool, shady
spot beside a spring, and Florence called to the
father to stop. &ldquo;Put him down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had he laid the boy on the ground
than she and Jo Ann began bathing his face
with their dampened handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute, se&ntilde;orita. I bring you water,&rdquo;
spoke up the father. He lined the deep crown
of his hat with large green leaves and filled it
with water, then brought it over to the girls.</p>
<p>Florence dipped her hands into the water and
let it drip gently on the boy&rsquo;s face and neck.</p>
<p>As soon as the cold water touched his face
the boy&rsquo;s eyelids fluttered open.</p>
<p>Florence turned to the father. &ldquo;Bring me
more water&mdash;I want to give him a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a nod of assent, the man stooped down,
broke off a large leaf from an elephant&rsquo;s-ear
plant near by and folded it into a cup which he
quickly filled with water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Florence then lifted the boy&rsquo;s head slightly
and held it while Jo Ann held the improvised
cup to his lips. After she had laid him down
again, his eyes opened wider, and he stared
blankly at the girls for a moment.</p>
<p>Then his gaze fell upon his mother, and he
murmured faintly, &ldquo;<i>Mi&mdash;Ma-m&aacute;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cry of joy, she exclaimed. &ldquo;Ah, my
Pepito. You have come back to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary that we be very careful,&rdquo;
Florence cautioned the parents. &ldquo;The boy must
not talk yet. After he rests longer, then he can
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien!</i> Just as you say.&rdquo; The tears began to
flow down the father&rsquo;s cheeks again as he added
in a choked voice, &ldquo;If it had not been for you,
se&ntilde;oritas, my Pepito would have been buried.
Carlitos and I were digging his grave when you
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shudder of horror swept over both girls as
they realized how narrow had been the escape
from such a tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not take your little boy back up
on the mountain,&rdquo; Florence went on. &ldquo;He will
be sick again, if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him to move his family down to the
cave,&rdquo; spoke up Jo Ann eagerly. The thought
darted through her mind, &ldquo;I could find out
about the blue-eyed boy, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; Florence replied, then translated
her suggestion to the father.</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment then began haltingly,
&ldquo;But my charcoal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother broke in rapidly, &ldquo;You can come
Up here and make your charcoal. We will stay
at the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; A strange expression of fear
passed over his face as he glanced at the girls,
then at his wife.</p>
<p>She stepped over hastily to his side and began
talking to him in a low tone.</p>
<p>Surprised at these strange actions, the girls
looked questioningly at each other.</p>
<p>As Florence turned to see how the boy was
faring, she overheard the mother say, &ldquo;It will
be all right, <i>Pap&aacute;</i>. These are our friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;I&rsquo;M GOING TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Jo Ann, who had been watching the play of
expressions on their faces intently, now experienced
a feeling of relief as she saw the father
nod and smile.</p>
<p>He then addressed Florence, &ldquo;<i>Bien.</i> I go
bring my family. You wait here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Florence agreed.</p>
<p>After the father had left, Jo Ann remarked,
&ldquo;Now that the boy is so much better we can
take time to eat our lunch while we&rsquo;re waiting
for the father to bring the rest of the family
down. I&rsquo;m beginning to get hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence glanced up at the sun and noted its
position. &ldquo;Why, it must be after two o&rsquo;clock!
No wonder you&rsquo;re hungry. The suspense has
been too great for us to think of ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this has been the most exciting experience
I&rsquo;ve ever been through. It does seem almost
like a miracle, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Her gaze fell on the
boy, whose great black eyes were glancing from
one face to the other.</p>
<p>Florence picked up the package containing
their lunch and offered some to the mother.</p>
<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation she took out a
small chocolate cake, looked at it curiously, then
bit off a tiny piece. Her face beamed. &ldquo;Ah,
cak&eacute;! For my Pepito.&rdquo; She leaned over and
touched the cake to the boy&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Florence spoke up quickly, &ldquo;No, no. You eat
that one. That kind very bad for Pepito. I&rsquo;ll
give him one of these.&rdquo; She picked up a graham
cracker and handed it to the mother to give to
him.</p>
<p>No sooner had the boy tasted the cracker than
he began to eat rapidly, as if he were very
hungry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that child was about starved,&rdquo; said
Jo Ann. &ldquo;He must have been weak from lack of
food to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably not had anything to eat except
some cold <i>tortillas</i> since we saw them the
other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not eat another bite,&rdquo; said Jo Ann
quickly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s save the rest of our lunch for
those children. I&rsquo;m hungry, but I&rsquo;m not half as
hungry as they must be. I can wait to eat till we
get back home.&rdquo; She handed the rest of the
lunch over to the mother saying, &ldquo;For your children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>gracias</i>, se&ntilde;oritas. You are too good,&rdquo;
the mother said, smiling. In a rapid flow of
Spanish she began telling Florence that they
had been traveling for days and had had very
little food. &ldquo;When <i>Pap&aacute;</i> make the charcoal,
then we will have food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the pause that followed, Florence told Jo
Ann what the woman had said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange they came away up here to make
the charcoal. It looks as if they&rsquo;d have stopped
sooner,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked. &ldquo;Hurry up and ask
her about the blue-eyed boy, Carlitos. Ask her
if he and Pepito are twins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother shook her head when Florence
asked, &ldquo;Which is the older one&mdash;Carlitos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Pepito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t look a bit alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange expression passed over the woman&rsquo;s
face; then she said slowly, &ldquo;Carlitos is not my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann caught this last remark and spoke up
eagerly: &ldquo;Ask her if he is related to her family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Florence obediently asked this question,
the mother merely shook her head without
saying a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her if his eyes aren&rsquo;t a deep blue, just as
I said,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can see she doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about
him. You can find that out for yourself in a few
minutes. He&rsquo;ll be coming down with the family
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, believe me, I&rsquo;m more convinced than
ever that there is something strange about that
boy, and I&rsquo;m going to solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to do your investigating
while they&rsquo;re back in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly afterward they heard the clatter of
the donkey&rsquo;s feet on the trail, and soon the
family arrived at the spring. The mother ran
to meet them and quickly divided the girls&rsquo;
lunch among them; then she took the baby from
the father&rsquo;s arms and sat down with it beside
Pepito again.</p>
<p>While the hungry children were eating, Jo
Ann got a good look at Carlitos&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;See,
Florence,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I was right. The
boy&rsquo;s eyes are a beautiful deep blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re right. His eyes are blue and his
features are finely cut. He&rsquo;s entirely different
from the others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Noticing that the father was watching them
closely, Florence changed the subject by saying,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were starting home this minute
if we&rsquo;re going to get there before dark, as
we promised.&rdquo; She turned to the father. &ldquo;Are
you ready to start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; he replied, then stooped down
quickly and picked up Pepito, who was struggling
to rise to his feet.</p>
<p>In a few more minutes the long procession
started down the narrow trail, the father with
Pepito at the head, and Jo Ann in the rear with
Carlitos and one of the little girls.</p>
<p>Florence smiled as she noticed that Jo Ann
was beside the blue-eyed boy and trying to talk
to him.</p>
<p>It did not take Jo Ann long to discover that
Carlitos knew no English. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be an
American, then,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably a
German or some other kind of a foreigner.&rdquo; She
asked him a few questions in her broken
Spanish but, as it was very difficult for him to
understand her, she gave up trying to talk
finally and turned her attention to the little girl,
who kept looking up at her adoringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>When at last they drew near their house,
Florence pointed it out to the father, saying,
&ldquo;This is where we live. We will have to leave
you now. You must be very careful with Pepito,
remember. Don&rsquo;t let him go back up the mountain
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man nodded a vigorous assent. &ldquo;All right,
se&ntilde;orita. We will take much care of Pepito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann spoke up eagerly just then: &ldquo;Florence,
tell them that we&rsquo;ll come down to the cave tomorrow
to see how Pepito is getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Florence had translated this message,
the two girls called, &ldquo;<i>Adios!</i>&rdquo; to the family and
a special one to Pepito, then hurried on to the
house.</p>
<p>No sooner had they greeted Mrs. Blackwell
and Peggy than they began recounting their adventures
excitedly.</p>
<p>When Florence told of discovering that
Pepito was still alive, both her listeners gasped
in amazement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so thankful you girls knew what to do
and could save that boy from being buried
alive,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell said, after Jo Ann and
Florence had finished their entire story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am, too,&rdquo; agreed Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good thing we carried a lunch along
with us,&rdquo; Jo Ann added. &ldquo;Those poor children
were almost starved. They&rsquo;d had hardly anything
to eat for days. You should have seen the
way they gobbled up the cakes we gave them&mdash;even
Pepito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you gave your lunch to the children, you
must be very hungry by this time,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are,&rdquo; both replied together.</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d be about
starved, so I have supper all ready. Maybe
you&rsquo;ll be too excited to eat, though, Jo, since
you&rsquo;ve discovered that there really is a mystery
about the blue-eyed boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;d notice it. We&rsquo;ll be ready to eat
as soon as we wash our hands and faces,&rdquo; Jo Ann
said, rising. As she started toward the door she
suddenly stopped and wheeled about. &ldquo;I just
thought of something! Those poor little children
won&rsquo;t have a thing to eat tonight or in the
morning. All their possessions were in those
little bundles on the burro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo; Florence drew a long sigh.
&ldquo;Well, I certainly can&rsquo;t enjoy my supper knowing
that they&rsquo;re not going to have any.&rdquo; She
turned to Peggy. &ldquo;What have you got for supper
that we can take to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;I made a lot of potato salad, for one
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence shook her head. &ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t
like that, I&rsquo;m sure. They&rsquo;ve probably never
tasted any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know they like beans and rice
and tomatoes,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;We can take
those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not take a box of crackers, Florence?&rdquo;
Mrs. Blackwell suggested. &ldquo;They can eat them
while they&rsquo;re waiting for the other things to
cook.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Florence at once began helping
Jo Ann to gather up the food, and soon the two
girls were starting down the short cut to the
cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, or it&rsquo;ll be dark,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell
called after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She needn&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; smiled Jo Ann. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
step on it. We&rsquo;ve got to go right past where we
saw that snake yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s brows drew together in a frown,
but she replied determinedly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to
let that stop me. We can watch more closely this
time. I wasn&rsquo;t paying as much attention as I
should have yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snake or no snake, I&rsquo;m not going to drop
this food down the mountain as I did my basket
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously they made their way down the
steep path. When they reached the base of the
cliff and started around toward the cave, they
heard the sound of voices.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the family,&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;If
we run we can catch up with them and won&rsquo;t
have to go all the way to the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started off at a swift pace and soon
reached the little procession.</p>
<p>Florence called to the mother, &ldquo;Wait a minute.
We&rsquo;ve brought you some things to eat.&rdquo; She
and Jo Ann handed the packages to the mother
and Carlitos.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s face broke into a wide smile.
&ldquo;<i>Muchas gracias</i>, se&ntilde;oritas,&rdquo; she said as she took
the packages.</p>
<p>The grandmother and the father also joined
in thanking the girls.</p>
<p>As they turned to leave, Florence remarked
to the father, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help to look after the
family while you go up and make your charcoal.
We&rsquo;ll come again tomorrow. We hope
Pepito will be much better by then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face broke into a smile. &ldquo;Our
friends, you are most kind. We have much
gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A SOILED YELLOWED ENVELOPE</span></h2>
<p>The next morning, when they were at the
breakfast table, Jo Ann suggested that they go
down to the goat ranch to see if they could get
some milk to take to Pepito. &ldquo;Do you want to
go this time, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell, if I thought I&rsquo;d get to see your mysterious
boy, I&rsquo;d go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d see him, because he and
the father are going back up the mountain to
finish making their charcoal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll stay here, then. You two go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had washed the dishes and finished
their other tasks, Florence and Jo Ann set out
toward the goat ranch, Jo Ann swinging a
bucket on her arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>When they came in sight of the little pink
adobe house, Florence remarked, &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re
here getting the milk, I believe I&rsquo;ll see if I can
buy some corn to take to the cave family for
their <i>tortillas</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; approved Jo Ann.</p>
<p>After they had exchanged greetings with the
woman at the house, Florence asked about the
milk and corn, explaining their reason for
wanting them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little boy,&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;I
give you some milk to take to him. It is not the
kind of milk you get&mdash;it&rsquo;s goat&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence explained her answers to Jo Ann,
adding, &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll suit Pepito better, anyway.
He&rsquo;s probably never tasted cow&rsquo;s milk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the woman had filled the bucket and
had given them several ears of corn, they started
off toward the cave.</p>
<p>As they neared the cave opening, Florence
remarked, &ldquo;The family&rsquo;s here this time. I smell
food cooking. I&rsquo;m glad we brought that down
last night, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Jo Ann nodded an emphatic assent.</p>
<p>In a few more moments they stepped into the
entrance of the cave.</p>
<p>The mother looked up quickly, then smiled
broadly as she recognized the girls. &ldquo;Ah, good
morning, friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Pepito this morning?&rdquo; Florence
asked a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better.&rdquo; Her face was beaming. &ldquo;He
ate much of the food that you brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. We brought you some corn for
your <i>tortillas</i> and some milk for Pepito. He
must eat lots and drink much milk, then he will
get strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother caught hold of Florence&rsquo;s hand,
saying, &ldquo;A thousand thanks, se&ntilde;orita.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smile of greeting to the family, Jo
Ann crossed over to Pepito, who was lying on
the <i>petate</i> beside the baby watching his grandmother
knot a long slender fiber rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Jo Ann asked the
grandmother curiously, after she had talked a
moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Making bags for the charcoal,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, then, not
knowing the word for carry, she called over to
Florence, &ldquo;Does she mean they&rsquo;re going to
carry charcoal in that thing? I should think it&rsquo;d
fall through such big holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence came over beside Jo Ann and smilingly
translated her question into Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t fall through,&rdquo; Pepito replied
earnestly. He raised up and took the partly
finished bag from his grandmother and held it
up for Jo Ann to see. &ldquo;The charcoal is big. We
pack it with much care, and it no fall through
these holes,&rdquo; he added, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They fasten a large bag of charcoal on each
side of the burro so that all you can see is his
long ears sticking out between the bags,&rdquo;
Florence explained. &ldquo;It looks as if the bags of
charcoal were walking down the road.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>After watching how deftly the grandmother&rsquo;s
gnarled old hands tied the knots in the wiry
rope, Jo Ann said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a hammock
made like that. Ask her, Florence, if she could
make me a long strip that I could use for a
hammock. Tell her I&rsquo;ll buy it from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You catch hold of one end of the
strip and I the other, and we&rsquo;ll show her exactly
what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Florence had translated Jo Ann&rsquo;s request
and the two girls had demonstrated their
meaning by gestures, the grandmother&rsquo;s brown
wrinkled face began to beam. She took the strip
from them, saying, &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;.</i> I understand. I finish
this one for you. You have been so good&mdash;you
give us back our Pepito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you need these bags for the charcoal
right away,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann, who had caught the
meaning of the grandmother&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Tell her
I&rsquo;m not in a hurry for the hammock. I can wait
till after they sell the charcoal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Florence had passed this remark on, the
grandmother replied, &ldquo;I make you one. When
my son sell the charcoal, he will bring me more
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>After talking for a few minutes more Jo Ann
remarked to Florence, &ldquo;Ask the mother something
more about Carlitos, now. If he isn&rsquo;t their
child, ask her where they got him and what
nationality he is&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t understand English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence began to laugh. &ldquo;Hold on! I can&rsquo;t
ask all of those questions at once. I&rsquo;m a little
dubious about asking any at all. They don&rsquo;t
seem to like to talk about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but I&rsquo;ve got to find out about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ell, I&rsquo;ll see what I can find out, but I
can&rsquo;t promise you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence walked back to the mother, who was
cooking beans over the fire in the middle of the
cave. After chatting with her awhile she tactfully
brought up the subject of Carlitos. &ldquo;How
long has Carlitos lived with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for a long time. He is as one of our
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old was he when you took him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like Rosita over there.&rdquo; The mother gestured
toward the smaller one of the two little
girls.</p>
<p>Florence glanced over at the child, who, she
judged, must be about a year and a half old. So
Carlitos had been with this family about seven
years, she thought. &ldquo;Where is his mother?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, she died and left her baby with me. I
was his nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was too bad. Wasn&rsquo;t there any relative
to take him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought darted through Florence&rsquo;s mind
that perhaps after all Carlitos was American or
English. Since he had been so young when he
was taken into this family, he could not have
remembered any of his native language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was his mother an American?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and she was so good to me and so beautiful.
She had eyes of blue just like Carlitos&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Just then Jo Ann crossed over to Florence&rsquo;s
side. &ldquo;Did I hear right? Did she say Carlitos
was an American?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was right at first about his not being a
Mexican. What else did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence quickly recounted all that the
mother had told her.</p>
<p>When she had finished, Jo Ann said, &ldquo;Well,
there&rsquo;s something queer about a beautiful
American woman leaving her baby with an
ignorant Indian nurse. Ask her where his father
is. That child&rsquo;s bound to have some relatives
somewhere. Looks strange to me that, as poor as
this family is, they&rsquo;d keep Carlitos when they
can hardly feed their own children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right, I&rsquo;ll ask her. She doesn&rsquo;t seem
to mind talking about him today as much as she
did yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned to the mother. &ldquo;Why did you
have to keep Carlitos when you have so many
children? Where was his father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
He no come back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the mine. The beautiful American
woman go every day to watch for her husband,
but he no come. It was cold, and she got sick.
She had much cough, and one day she died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the girls&rsquo; surprise the woman walked over
to the grandmother and began talking in a low,
rapid voice. The grandmother nodded and
smiled over at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said something about us, or the grandmother
wouldn&rsquo;t have looked over at us that
way,&rdquo; said Jo Ann. &ldquo;At least she&rsquo;s smiling&mdash;that&rsquo;s
encouraging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They noticed the woman go over into a dark
recess, then come back shortly. In the light of
the fire they could see that she held a soiled yellowed
envelope in her hand.</p>
<p>On coming closer the woman said earnestly,
&ldquo;You are American like his <i>mam&aacute;</i> and <i>pap&aacute;</i>.
You have been good to us like they were.&rdquo; She
touched Florence on the cheek first, then Jo Ann.
&ldquo;And you are beautiful like his <i>mam&aacute;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>She held up a sealed envelope. &ldquo;His <i>mam&aacute;</i>
give this to me. I keep it for Carlitos. When he
get big, I give it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence took the envelope into her hand. She
uttered a little gasp. &ldquo;Why, this is a letter! It is
addressed to a man in New York.&rdquo; She read the
name out loud. &ldquo;Mr. E. P. Eldridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for Pete&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t she mail that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not stopping to listen to Jo Ann, Florence
asked the woman quickly, &ldquo;Is Carlitos&rsquo; name
Eldridge&mdash;Carlitos Eldridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman hesitated a moment; then, after
Florence had repeated the name Eldridge several
times, she nodded her head. &ldquo;Yes, I think
that was the name. It has been many years&mdash;I
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a letter. Why didn&rsquo;t you put it in the
mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman looked blank at this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Carlitos&rsquo; mother tell you to put this
in the mail?&rdquo; Florence asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. His <i>mam&aacute;</i> speak very little Spanish. She
only been in Mexico a little time. When she was
dying she give this to me and tell me, &lsquo;No let
big mean man get this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the big mean man?&rdquo; Florence
asked, puzzled at this new turn in her story.</p>
<p>The woman broke into a confused account
which Florence later translated to Jo Ann. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make out exactly what she&rsquo;s talking about,
but she says some big man who had something
to do with the mine was mean to Carlitos&rsquo; mother
after her husband had disappeared. She said
they were all afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s no excuse for her not mailing the
letter,&rdquo; Jo Ann said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All she understood was to keep this from that
man,&rdquo; Florence explained. &ldquo;She&rsquo;d never seen a
letter before in her life. She couldn&rsquo;t read or
write. And the American woman couldn&rsquo;t explain
it to her, you know. The only other people
at this mine were Indian peons like themselves,
so there was no one she could go to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to realize that she didn&rsquo;t know what
a letter was when she saw one,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked,
then looked down at the envelope with
renewed interest. &ldquo;I wish we dared to open this
and read it, but of course we can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the only thing for us to do is to mail it
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied
quickly. &ldquo;It might get lost. It has to be carried
so far before it even gets to a postoffice. Besides,
it&rsquo;s about seven years since this letter was written.
Why not write a letter to this address explaining
the situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence pondered over this plan a moment,
then spoke up briskly: &ldquo;I have a better idea than
that. I&rsquo;ll write to Daddy and explain it all to
him and have him telegraph to this Mr. Eldridge
in New York. That&rsquo;ll save lots of
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>Florence turned and explained to the woman
that she and Jo Ann were going to send word to
this man whose name was written on the envelope.
&ldquo;It may help Carlitos,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are so good to want to help Carlitos,&rdquo;
the woman exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could find something to write this
address on, but we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;We
must look at it very carefully so as to be sure we
get it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls read and reread the address, then
repeated it aloud to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s hurry and get home before we forget
it,&rdquo; said Jo Ann.</p>
<p>After a hasty &ldquo;<i>Adios</i>&rdquo; to the family, the two
hurried out of the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">THE BEAR RETURNS</span></h2>
<p>When the girls reached the house, almost
breathless from their rapid climb, Jo Ann immediately
burst out, &ldquo;I was right! There is a
mystery&mdash;about the blue-eyed boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Jo,&rdquo; put in Florence. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get that address down first of all.&rdquo; She grabbed
up a piece of paper and scribbled down the address,
then showed it to Jo Ann. &ldquo;Is this right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann studied it carefully. &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure it
is.&rdquo; She turned back to Peggy and Mrs. Blackwell.
&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s an American! He&rsquo;s an orphan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought you said he couldn&rsquo;t speak
English!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;and he can&rsquo;t. He was left with this
family when he was a baby, and so naturally
doesn&rsquo;t know anything but Spanish. This Indian
woman, Mar&iacute;a, was his mother&rsquo;s servant while
she was up at the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds as if the boy must have come
from a well-to-do family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he did,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied, and Florence
added, &ldquo;I gathered from what Mar&iacute;a said
that his father was either the owner of the mine
or had an interest in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you tell us the whole story from beginning
to end, Florence,&rdquo; suggested Peggy. &ldquo;It
sounds so unlikely that an American boy of good
family would be left with poor ignorant Indians
like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got it straight in my mind either.
It&rsquo;s a mystery all right&mdash;a mystery that&rsquo;s far
from being solved. I&rsquo;ll tell you all we found out.&rdquo;
Florence recounted all that Mar&iacute;a had told her
and showed both her mother and Peggy the
piece of paper with the address which they had
seen on the envelope at the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jo and I think we ought to write to Daddy
at once and ask him to telegraph to this Mr.
Eldridge,&rdquo; she ended. &ldquo;What do you think of
that plan, Mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;d be a wise thing,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell
answered thoughtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d save a great
deal of time, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it would. Fortunately today&rsquo;s the day
we get our mail. I&rsquo;ll write my letter right away
and when the man comes, I&rsquo;ll give it to him to
take back. We won&rsquo;t get our mail again till next
Tuesday&mdash;four whole days to wait before we can
hear from Daddy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have some interesting information
for us by that time,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann.</p>
<p>While Florence busied herself with writing
the letter to her father, Jo Ann kept up a steady
chatter about the mystery of the blue-eyed boy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d certainly like to find out more about that
man that Mar&iacute;a kept calling the &lsquo;mean man.&rsquo;
What reason could he have had for having been
so hateful to Carlitos&rsquo; mother? From what Mar&iacute;a
said everybody else liked her. Another thing I
want to know is why his father disappeared so
suddenly and where he went. A mystery within
a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;You ought to be satisfied this
time, Jo. It&rsquo;ll keep you busy for a long time if
you untangle all this mix-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About a half hour later, Jo Ann caught sight
of a man with a big sombrero riding a burro
leisurely up the cart road toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; she called to Florence.
&ldquo;Is it the man that brings the mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence came running out on the porch. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the one. He&rsquo;s bringing us some groceries,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s run down and meet him. I can&rsquo;t wait
to see if I have any letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls tore off down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any mail for us?&rdquo; Florence asked on
nearing the rider.</p>
<p>The man nodded his head. &ldquo;Ah, many letters!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give them to me,&rdquo; Florence cried in Spanish,
then added to Peggy and Jo Ann, &ldquo;I know
Mother and I&rsquo;ll have one from Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I ought to have two or three!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here too,&rdquo; added Jo Ann.</p>
<p>The Indian slipped off the back of his
burro and slowly began untying one of the
bundles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d hurry,&rdquo; grumbled Jo Ann. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the slowest thing I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just have patience. You can&rsquo;t hurry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing&rsquo;s certain, none of the mail
could&rsquo;ve been lost out of that bundle&mdash;it&rsquo;s tied
so tightly,&rdquo; smiled Peggy.</p>
<p>Finally the man handed a bunch of letters and
papers to Florence, and she sorted them out
quickly and gave Peggy and Jo Ann their share;
then all three hurried back to the house. Several
minutes later the man brought in the groceries
and other articles that they had ordered sent out
from the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Florence gave him the letter she had just written
to her father, saying, &ldquo;Be very careful&mdash;don&rsquo;t
lose this letter. It&rsquo;s <i>very</i> important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita, I <i>sabe</i>! I&rsquo;ll be careful.&rdquo; The man
nodded, then went back to his burro.</p>
<p>As soon as the girls had finished reading their
mail, they picked up their groceries and carried
them out to the kitchen.</p>
<p>When Jo Ann unwrapped the butter and the
bacon, she remarked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with these
things? We won&rsquo;t dare put them in our refrigerator
box down at the spring. That old bear
would be sure to find them again. We&rsquo;ve just got
to get him. I was too excited over saving Pepito
yesterday to think about anything else. But we
must watch again tonight for that bear. He&rsquo;ll be
getting hungry by this time and&rsquo;ll come back for
another pig. Your mother&rsquo;ll let us go, won&rsquo;t she,
Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we go, I&rsquo;m going to take a sweater
and a cushion,&rdquo; spoke up Peggy. &ldquo;I got cold the
other night, and it was so uncomfortable sitting
on that rough hard ledge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>The other two began to laugh, and Jo Ann
added, &ldquo;Whoever heard of taking a cushion on a
bear hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get too comfortable, you&rsquo;ll go to sleep
and tumble off the ledge,&rdquo; put in Florence.
&ldquo;Then the bear won&rsquo;t have to break into the pen
for his supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with Jo around,&rdquo; Peggy laughed teasingly.
&ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s such a good shot she&rsquo;d have
the bear killed before he could take a step
toward me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann grinned. &ldquo;You just wait till I get a
chance to demonstrate my marksmanship, Peg.
I&rsquo;ll show you that I am a good shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changing the subject&mdash;what&rsquo;re we going to
do with this butter and bacon?&rdquo; Florence
queried, looking at the two packages on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t leave the bacon in the kitchen,&rdquo;
Peggy cut in. &ldquo;The bear might smell it and come
snooping around here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about putting both the bacon and butter
in jars and hiding them down in the water
under a rock?&rdquo; suggested Jo Ann. &ldquo;That way he
could neither smell nor see the food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good plan,&rdquo; approved Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does get a brilliant idea once in a blue
moon,&rdquo; laughed Peggy.</p>
<p>They set to work at once to carry out Jo Ann&rsquo;s
plan and soon had the bacon and butter safely
hidden down in the stream just below the spring.</p>
<p>After the girls had eaten their midday meal
and washed the dishes, they stretched out on their
cots for a siesta.</p>
<p>Jo Ann called over to Peggy teasingly, &ldquo;Be
sure to take a long nap today. I don&rsquo;t want you
to go to sleep and tumble off the ledge tonight.
You&rsquo;d make so much noise that you&rsquo;d scare the
bear away, and I want to get him tonight sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need plenty of sleep yourself to keep
your eyes open to watch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence called over, &ldquo;You both&rsquo;d better stop
talking and go on to sleep, or you&rsquo;ll both tumble
off the ledge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Shortly after dark that evening Peggy and Jo
Ann started off toward the enclosure where the
pigs were kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly need the flashlight tonight,&rdquo;
Peggy remarked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark, isn&rsquo;t it? The moon
isn&rsquo;t up nearly so high as it was the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not gone far till they spied the white-clad
figure of Juan coming toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly am glad to see him,&rdquo; exclaimed
Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dreading crossing that ravine.
It&rsquo;s so dark and spooky down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry to see him myself,&rdquo; admitted
Jo Ann.</p>
<p>When Juan drew near, he motioned to them
to be quiet. In a low voice he said to Jo Ann, &ldquo;I
think the bear come tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d he say?&rdquo; asked Peggy curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but it was something
about the bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juan turned and led the way to the enclosure.
As he drew near he pointed over to it, saying
something about the pigs and the bear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he&rsquo;s saying something about the
pigs being restless,&rdquo; Jo Ann told Peggy in a low
voice. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear them? They didn&rsquo;t do
that way the other night. Sometimes animals
know instinctively when danger&rsquo;s near, and I
believe those pigs do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hurry and get up on that ledge before
the bear comes,&rdquo; Peggy whispered.</p>
<p>They climbed up the notched pole as rapidly
as they could and settled themselves on the ledge,
Jo Ann with her gun cocked, lying across her
lap. Juan remained below at the foot of the pole,
as he had before.</p>
<p>For what seemed an interminable time to
them they sat perfectly still waiting for the coming
of the bear. Every now and then Jo Ann
would fancy that she saw a dark shadow moving
below and would raise her gun, only to discover
that it was merely the shadow of a tree swaying
in the breeze. She noticed, too, that the pigs were
growing more restless. &ldquo;That old bear must be
prowling around near here,&rdquo; she thought. She
leaned over and strained her eyes to peer into the
darkness of the ravine beyond the moonlit space
directly below her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Not long afterwards she heard a slight cracking
sound. She peered instantly in the direction
from which it had come. Her eyes widened as
she saw a black shaggy head rear up above the
enclosure, one paw tearing at the poles.</p>
<p>Simultaneously she heard Peggy gasp in
fright.</p>
<p>Jo Ann raised her gun, waiting to get a good
aim before pulling the trigger. &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t miss
him. I&rsquo;ve got to kill him the first shot,&rdquo; she told
herself. &ldquo;If I miss, he&rsquo;ll get back in those dark
shadows, and I can&rsquo;t see him then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then there was a loud crashing noise. The
bear&rsquo;s head dropped out of sight as he pulled
out one of the poles.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the bear reared up again
and Jo Ann saw a long black arm reach through
the narrow opening. Just as he was jerking out
another pole she pulled the trigger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Almost simultaneously with the report of the
gun Jo Ann heard a deep growl, then the thud
of a heavy body falling. A few moments later
she was amazed to see a dark hulk shamble off
toward the darkness.</p>
<p>Instantly she pulled the trigger again. &ldquo;Oh,
shucks! I&rsquo;ve missed him!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>After the reverberations had died away she
turned to Peggy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hit him. He must
be wounded or he wouldn&rsquo;t have fallen so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard him make a queer choking noise,
above the squealing of the pigs!&rdquo; Peggy declared
excitedly.</p>
<p>Just then Juan called up, &ldquo;You hit him! You
hit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;.</i> I think so too,&rdquo; Jo Ann replied.</p>
<p>The three listened intently to the snapping of
branches and the clatter of loosened stones as the
bear made his way up the ravine. When the
sounds finally died away, Peggy started climbing
down the pole. When she was about halfway
down there sounded a loud crashing, and she
hurriedly scrambled back up the pole to the
ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the bear&rsquo;s coming back again,&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>After listening intently for a few moments, Jo
Ann said, &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s coming back.
I believe he&rsquo;s wounded&mdash;badly wounded.&rdquo; She
called down to Juan. &ldquo;Is it all right for us to
come down now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;oritas,&rdquo; he called back. &ldquo;The bear
gone.&rdquo; He waved his hand in the direction of the
ravine.</p>
<p>The girls cautiously climbed down the pole.</p>
<p>Jo Ann reloaded her gun and, holding it in
readiness, she made her way with Juan and
Peggy to the hole the bear had torn in the enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shine your flashlight down here, Peg,&rdquo; she
ordered. The next moment she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh,
look, here&rsquo;s some blood! I knew I hit him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did!&rdquo; Peggy cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita, you much good!&rdquo; Juan ejaculated,
then began jabbering so fast that Jo Ann
could not understand a single word. He kept gesturing
toward the trickle of blood leading
toward the ravine.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head. &ldquo;Not tonight, Juan.
<i>Ma&ntilde;ana</i> we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, ma&ntilde;ana</i>,&rdquo; he agreed and then set to work
repairing the hole the bear had torn in the enclosure,
while Peggy held the flashlight for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;ll be a long time before Mr.
Bear comes back here,&rdquo; Jo Ann declared in a
satisfied tone.</p>
<p>As soon as Juan had finished, the girls, with a
&ldquo;<i>Buenas noches</i>,&rdquo; to him, started off toward the
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">JO ANN&rsquo;S TROPHY</span></h2>
<p>When Jo Ann and Peggy reached the house,
Florence met them at the door. &ldquo;My, I&rsquo;m glad
to see you!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Ever since we heard
those shots, Mother and I&rsquo;ve been worried. Did
you kill the bear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I know I wounded him, because
I saw the blood on the ground,&rdquo; Jo Ann
replied, &ldquo;and I kind of believe I killed him. We
heard him shamble off up the ravine, but I don&rsquo;t
believe he went very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by that stream of blood, I feel
sure he couldn&rsquo;t have lasted long,&rdquo; Peggy
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; praised Florence. &ldquo;Now Juan
won&rsquo;t lose any more of his pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as it&rsquo;s daylight, I want to follow his
trail and see if I can find him,&rdquo; Jo Ann said.
&ldquo;Peggy wants to go, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to leave me behind this
time,&rdquo; Florence put in, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; Peggy and Jo Ann agreed together,
and Jo Ann added, &ldquo;Whoever wakes up first in
the morning calls the other two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after the first faint rays of dawn had
appeared the three girls set off down to the enclosure,
Jo Ann carrying the gun as before. On
reaching it they picked up the bloodstained trail
and followed it up the ravine.</p>
<p>After they had gone a short distance, the trail
led to the bank of the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
great big spot of blood. This must be the place
where we heard him stop last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence pointed down to the prints made by
the bear&rsquo;s paw. &ldquo;Poor thing! He was trying to
stop his wound with mud.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s and Peggy&rsquo;s eyes widened in surprise.
&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing!&rdquo; declared
Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did either,&rdquo; said Jo Ann. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know bears had that much sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy told me they did it, and he&rsquo;s had a
good deal of experience hunting. You can see
for yourself how the bear scraped up the mud
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He succeeded pretty well in stopping the
flow of blood,&rdquo; observed Jo Ann. &ldquo;The trail isn&rsquo;t
nearly as plain now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed the faint marks upward a short
distance. Suddenly they heard something moving
just ahead of them. They stopped instantly.
Jo Ann threw the gun to her shoulder, then cautiously
crept around a boulder so she could get
a better view.</p>
<p>Just at that moment she saw Juan rise up to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Juan!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I thought you were
the bear! I nearly shot you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Juan did not understand a word of what Jo
Ann had said, but he pointed excitedly, &ldquo;Look!
Here is the bear! You killed him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three girls hurriedly climbed up beside
Juan. Their eyes widened in amazement as they
saw the size of the shaggy black animal lying on
the ground before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, isn&rsquo;t he immense!&rdquo; gasped Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder he could tear down those poles
so easily,&rdquo; Jo Ann remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;d known he was that big I&rsquo;d have been
scared to death!&rdquo; exclaimed Peggy.</p>
<p>Hunter-like, Jo Ann stooped down and
pointed to the bullet wound in the animal&rsquo;s left
side. &ldquo;See! Here&rsquo;s where my bullet came out. I
hit him in the right shoulder when he was reaching
for that other pole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can breathe much more freely now that he&rsquo;s
actually dead,&rdquo; put in Peggy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a beauty,&rdquo; Jo Ann admired. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
bad I had to kill him, but we just couldn&rsquo;t have
him prowling around here. I&rsquo;m going to have a
bearskin rug to take home with me now, to show
what a good hunter I am. Florence, I wish you&rsquo;d
tell Juan to skin him for me. Tell him to be careful
about skinning the feet and to be sure to leave
on the claws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence quickly relayed Jo Ann&rsquo;s request to
Juan, and he nodded assent, &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, se&ntilde;oritas,&rdquo;
and went on in a rapid flow of Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to know if we want some of the
meat,&rdquo; Florence translated to the girls.</p>
<p>Peggy tilted her nose disdainfully. &ldquo;Bear
meat! That doesn&rsquo;t sound good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never have tasted bear steak,&rdquo; Jo Ann put
in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try it, wouldn&rsquo;t you, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might try a little. I&rsquo;ll tell him to cut us
off a small piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell him to take a great big piece to the
cave family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea!&rdquo; Florence praised.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have a feast. That&rsquo;ll probably be the
first meat they&rsquo;ve had in many a day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>After Florence had delivered this message to
Juan and they had exclaimed over the size of
the bear again, they turned around and set off for
the house.</p>
<p>When they came near they saw Mrs. Blackwell
waiting for them on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother!&rdquo; Florence called. &ldquo;Jo got the
bear all right! You just ought to see him. He&rsquo;s
huge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must&rsquo;ve been the old granddaddy of all
the bears in this part of the country,&rdquo; Peggy
added impressively.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell smiled. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m relieved
to hear that. I&rsquo;ve been worried every time you
girls&rsquo;ve been out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every now and then the rest of the day the
girls&rsquo; conversation would drift back to the subject
of the bear.</p>
<p>The next morning, when they were eating
breakfast, Jo Ann suggested that they go down to
the cave and see how the family was getting along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;I hope
they haven&rsquo;t let Pepito eat too much of that bear
meat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get to see Carlitos again, and the
father, Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; Jo Ann added. &ldquo;I have lots of
questions that I want to ask Jos&eacute;. I believe he can
tell us more about Carlitos than Mar&iacute;a could. I
want to find out more about that big mean man
that she kept referring to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going without fail this time,&rdquo; put
in Peggy. &ldquo;I want to see that wonderful blue-eyed
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hardly have time to go this morning&mdash;we
got up so late. Let&rsquo;s have lunch a little
earlier so we&rsquo;ll have a long time this afternoon
to stay with the cave family,&rdquo; suggested Florence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell spoke up, smiling: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as
curious as Peggy is to see the blue-eyed boy. I
wonder if you couldn&rsquo;t bring him up here and
let me take a look at him. I&rsquo;d like to see Pepito
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll do that very thing,&rdquo; Jo Ann
replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pepito&rsquo;ll probably not be strong enough to
come yet,&rdquo; Florence said quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see
how he is today, and maybe he&rsquo;ll be able to make
the trip up here in a few more days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes began to shine. &ldquo;I know what
let&rsquo;s do! As soon as Pepito&rsquo;s well enough to come,
let&rsquo;s have a little party for the cave children and
the ones at the goat ranch.&rdquo; She asked hastily,
&ldquo;Would that disturb you too much, Mrs. Blackwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Blackwell shook her head. &ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d love
to have a party for them. I doubt if they&rsquo;ve ever
had one in all their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure they haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Florence,
&ldquo;and it&rsquo;ll be almost as much fun for us as it will
be for them. Don&rsquo;t you think so, Peggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do. I&rsquo;m strong for the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just after they had sat down to eat their lunch,
a few hours later, they heard the clattering sound
of hoofbeats coming down the road. &ldquo;Listen!
That isn&rsquo;t a burro&mdash;sounds like a horse!&rdquo; exclaimed
Florence. &ldquo;Who in the world would be
riding a horse around here? I&rsquo;m going to see
who&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>She sprang up and started to the door, the
other two quickly following her example. They
had not watched long before they saw a horse
and rider appear over the edge of the mesa.</p>
<p>A few minutes later Florence suddenly cried
excitedly, &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Daddy!&rdquo; Off she flew down
the trail, fleet as a deer, to meet him. Peggy
turned to Mrs. Blackwell and passed on the good
news of Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Blackwell,
her eyes sparkling. She hurried out on the
porch and waited eagerly for him and Florence.</p>
<p>As soon as the first greetings had been exchanged,
Dr. Blackwell gazed down at his wife
appraisingly and remarked, &ldquo;How well you
look! You&rsquo;re recuperating much more rapidly
than I&rsquo;d thought possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this invigorating mountain air and
such good nurses I couldn&rsquo;t help but get well in
a hurry,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell replied, with a smile
that included all three girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>In a little break in the conversation Florence
spoke up, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time for lunch, Daddy.
We had just sat down to the table. Come on before
everything gets cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t need a second invitation. I&rsquo;m terribly
hungry after that long hot ride,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell
replied as he escorted his wife to the table.</p>
<p>No sooner were they all seated than Jo Ann
asked Dr. Blackwell, &ldquo;Did you send that telegram
to that Mr. Eldridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded. &ldquo;Yes, I sent it, but I got word
there was no one by that name at that address.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;I
was so in hopes we could find some of Carlitos&rsquo;
relatives. What&rsquo;ll we do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already written to the chief of police to
see if he can trace this Mr. Eldridge,&rdquo; Dr.
Blackwell replied. He smiled over at Florence.
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t make much out of part of your letter&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t get the connection between a blue-eyed
boy in the poor Indian family and the man
in New York. Suppose you girls start at the beginning
and tell me all you know about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Florence nodded over at Jo Ann. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
story. You tell it. You&rsquo;re the one who discovered
the blue-eyed boy and became interested in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Jo Ann plunged into an account
of seeing Carlitos and Pepito the first time, then
on till she came to the trip up the mountain. She
stopped and smiled over at Florence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your
turn now. You were the star actor and doctor in
this part of the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence obediently took up the account
where Jo Ann had broken off.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell listened attentively to their
every word, and when they had finished he
praised both girls highly, Jo Ann for her detective
ability, and Florence for her first-aid skill
in saving the boy&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see this sick
boy while I&rsquo;m up here and give him a thorough
examination. And I certainly want to see the
blue-eyed boy. I&rsquo;m as interested in his story as
you are. All the time you&rsquo;ve been talking about
this mysterious boy I&rsquo;ve been racking my brain
to recall a rumor I heard some time ago about
an American who was down here searching for
a brother whom he had not heard from for several
years. I was wondering if there could possibly
be any connection between him and your
story. When I go back to the city, I&rsquo;ll see if I can
find out anything more about this man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d already planned to go down to see the
cave family this afternoon, and so we&rsquo;ll take you
with us,&rdquo; spoke up Florence. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very far
to the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell looked over questioningly at his
wife, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to go off and leave
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; Mrs. Blackwell replied.
&ldquo;I always take a nap right after lunch.&rdquo; She
smiled and added, &ldquo;Your orders, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell turned to Florence again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
go with you girls while your mother&rsquo;s taking her
nap, but I won&rsquo;t stay long.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">JOS&Eacute;&rsquo;S STRANGE STORY</span></h2>
<p>A short time later the three girls and Dr.
Blackwell went down to the cave, reaching there
just as the family were finishing their feast of
bear meat and the other food the girls had given
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go in and talk to them first and tell
them who you are, Dad,&rdquo; Florence murmured.</p>
<p>She walked on inside and quickly explained
to Jos&eacute; that her father, who was a doctor, had
come down to see how Pepito was getting
along.</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; stepped forward and politely shook hands
with Dr. Blackwell; then each member of his
family timidly followed his example.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much interested in your son Pepito,&rdquo; Dr.
Blackwell told Jos&eacute; in his fluent Spanish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to see if there&rsquo;s anything I can do to help
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; hesitated a moment, then began apologetically,
&ldquo;I no have money and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a little gesture of his hand Dr. Blackwell
dismissed this objection. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.
I don&rsquo;t want money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this Jos&eacute; turned and called Pepito
to his side.</p>
<p>Knowing the nature of the Indian so well, Dr.
Blackwell realized that he must win Pepito&rsquo;s
confidence first before he could make a complete
examination.</p>
<p>While he was busy with Pepito, Mar&iacute;a called
the three girls to the back of the cave. She
gestured proudly to the baby lying in a rope
hammock. &ldquo;See, my Pepito fix this like you
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann smiled approvingly. &ldquo;That was clever
of Pepito to use my idea of a charcoal bag for a
hammock, wasn&rsquo;t it, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was clever of him to fasten it to these stalactites,
too,&rdquo; added Peggy. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they beautiful?
They&rsquo;re so white and sparkling back here
where the smoke hasn&rsquo;t reached them. Stalactites
always remind me of big icicles hanging
from the roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticing Carlitos at her side just then, Jo Ann
remarked to Florence, &ldquo;Before you forget it,
you&rsquo;d better tell Carlitos and the other children
about the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; As Florence knew that the word
party had no meaning for the children she began
explaining about the cakes and <i>dulces</i> that
she and the girls would have up at the house for
them. Immediately their faces began to beam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, se&ntilde;orita, we&rsquo;ll be most happy to come!&rdquo;
Carlitos explained, acting as spokesman for the
younger children.</p>
<p>As soon as Dr. Blackwell had completed the
examination of Pepito, he came over beside the
girls. With the keenest interest he eyed Carlitos
and talked to him for a few minutes; then he
turned to Florence and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to
your mother now, but you girls may stay as long
as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be along in a little while,&rdquo; Florence replied.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite ready to leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he had given the parents a few directions
about caring for Pepito, he bade them all
&ldquo;<i>Adios</i>&rdquo; and left.</p>
<p>No sooner had he gone than Jo Ann suggested
to Florence that she ask Jos&eacute; about the part the
big mean boss had played in Carlitos&rsquo; life. &ldquo;Ask
him what made that man so mean to Carlitos&rsquo;
mother and if he has any idea what became of
his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll do my best, but first I want to tell
Mar&iacute;a about Daddy&rsquo;s not being able to find that
Mr. Eldridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Florence had talked to Mar&iacute;a a few
minutes, she began questioning Jos&eacute;. Jo Ann
listened intently to their conversation, but Jos&eacute;
talked so rapidly that she could catch only a
word now and then. Finally, discouraged, she
remarked to Peggy, &ldquo;Why is it that foreigners
always talk so much faster than Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Peggy laughed. &ldquo;It does sound that way, but
I suppose they really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of her failure to understand much, Jo
Ann persisted in listening and watching the expression
on their faces. All at once she saw Florence&rsquo;s
eyes widen as if in surprise. &ldquo;What is it,
Florence?&rdquo; she broke out impulsively. &ldquo;What
did he tell you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned quickly. &ldquo;Oh, he said this
mean boss was plotting to get rid of Carlitos!
That&rsquo;s why he took his family away from that
mine and has been hiding up here in the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why did that man want to get rid of Carlitos?&rdquo;
Jo Ann asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure that out yet. He said that this
mean boss had given orders for all the boys who
were large enough to help at the mine. Jos&eacute; and
Mar&iacute;a sent Pepito up to work but kept Carlitos
away&mdash;they were afraid the man would mistreat
him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why should this man want to mistreat
Carlitos?&rdquo; Jo Ann queried curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One reason, Jos&eacute; said, was that this man had
been so mean to Carlitos&rsquo; mother. They had also
suspected that he&rsquo;d had something to do with the
disappearance of his father and so were afraid
to let him know that they even had Carlitos. Jos&eacute;
said they moved &rsquo;way back up in the mountains
to keep him from finding out about Carlitos.
Jos&eacute; himself kept on working at the mine,
though. All went well till one day when Pepito
was sick and couldn&rsquo;t go to work and Carlitos
slipped off to the mine and took his place, because
he was afraid the boss would beat Pepito
when he returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man must&rsquo;ve been a terrible creature,&rdquo;
put in Jo Ann indignantly. &ldquo;But go on. What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, while Carlitos was working at the
mine, the boss saw him and became suspicious
about him. He asked Jos&eacute; all kinds of questions
about Carlitos, but Jos&eacute; wouldn&rsquo;t answer. He
just shrugged his shoulders, threw up his hands
and kept saying, &lsquo;No <i>sabe</i>.&rsquo; That made the boss
furious, as well as more suspicious, and he
ordered Jos&eacute; to make Carlitos work all the time
thereafter. That evening, when Jos&eacute; was leaving
the mine, he chanced to overhear one of the miners
bragging to another about the easy money he
was going to get from the boss for kidnaping the
blue-eyed boy for him. Jos&eacute; was immediately
terrified, because he knew that the boy was Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated.</p>
<p>Florence turned back to Jos&eacute;, and after talking
to him again she translated to Jo Ann and
Peggy, &ldquo;Jos&eacute; said on hearing this that he rushed
home and told Mar&iacute;a and the grandmother that
they must all leave immediately. They packed
up their few possessions on the burro and left
that very night. They wandered over the mountains
then till they came here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann. &ldquo;That
man&rsquo;s a demon. I feel sure he had something to
do with the disappearance of Carlitos&rsquo; father.
Ask Jos&eacute;, Florence, what Carlitos&rsquo; father did at
the mine&mdash;if he was the owner and if this mean
boss had been in his employ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; Once more Florence translated Jo
Ann&rsquo;s questions to Jos&eacute;. All eagerness, the two
girls waited for his reply.</p>
<p>This time Jo Ann was able to catch the answer.
Her eyes shone with excitement as she
broke out, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why that mean boss wanted to
get rid of Carlitos. Carlitos is by rights the
owner of the mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;he is!&rdquo; Florence exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Jo, you&rsquo;ve run into a thrilling mystery
this time, sure enough!&rdquo; Peggy burst out in an
excited voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sure this mean boss was responsible for
the disappearance of Carlitos&rsquo; father, too,&rdquo; Jo
Ann went on. &ldquo;He wanted to keep the control
of the mine in his own hands. He wanted to get
rid of Carlitos so there&rsquo;d be no possible chance
of anyone&rsquo;s ever claiming the mine. Ask Jos&eacute;,
Florence, how long Carlitos&rsquo; father had lived at
the mine&mdash;where the mine is and what the name
of it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Florence nodded. &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After talking with Jos&eacute; a few minutes, she explained
to Jo Ann, &ldquo;Don Carlos&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
Jos&eacute; calls Carlitos&rsquo; father, had come down from
the United States to inspect his mine and had
been there only a short time. I gathered from
what he said that Don Carlos had not liked the
way the Mexican boss was handling things and
had dismissed him. It was only a short time after
that, he said, that Don Carlos disappeared and
the boss took charge of the mine again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That proves to me that the boss did steal the
mine,&rdquo; Jo Ann said in an emphatic tone. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t
it sound that way to you, Peg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it does.&rdquo; Peggy shook her head dubiously
and added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be able to unravel
this mystery&mdash;it&rsquo;s too complicated for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute; said it was a silver mine and that they
called it La Esperanza,&rdquo; Florence went on. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t tell me where it was. All he did was to
wave his hand toward the range of mountains
across the valley and said it was beyond that. He
could find it himself, of course. I asked him how
they carried out the silver ore from the mine&mdash;if
there weren&rsquo;t a railroad near&mdash;and he looked
blank and then shook his head and said they carried
it out on burros.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly a poky way to carry the
ore,&rdquo; observed Jo Ann. &ldquo;It looks as if they ought
to be able to build a railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it might be too steep for a railroad. And
this is Mexico, remember. Labor&rsquo;s cheaper than
modern machinery. Come on, let&rsquo;s hurry up to
the house and talk it all over with Daddy before
he leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Peggy agreed.</p>
<p>As the girls started off, Florence called over
her shoulder to the children, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to
come to my house <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE PI&Ntilde;ATA</span></h2>
<p>Early the next morning the three girls began
making preparations for the party for the little
Mexican children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make some fudge,&rdquo; suggested Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be something new to them,&rdquo; Florence
told her. &ldquo;I can make some molasses candy out
of this brown sugar. Maybe they&rsquo;ll know what
that is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to have some kind of cakes,
too,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;I can make pretty good
doughnuts. Do you think the children would like
them, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they would. They won&rsquo;t know what
they are, but they&rsquo;ll like them. I doubt if these
children even know what candy is. Living out
in the mountains as they have, they&rsquo;ve probably
never tasted many sweets. I know this party will
be a real treat to them and their mothers, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>When they had finished their cooking, Florence
remarked, &ldquo;Now we must decorate the <i>olla</i>
for the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy smiled. &ldquo;I know what an <i>olla</i> is&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just a big earthen water jar, but what is a <i>pin</i>&mdash;<i>pin</i>&mdash;or
whatever you called it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m wondering, too,&rdquo; added Jo
Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when we fill this <i>olla</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to
the big pottery jar on the table&mdash;&ldquo;with the candy
and doughnuts and decorate the outside with
gay colors, then it&rsquo;ll be called a <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do with it then?&rdquo; queried Jo
Ann.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it up by a rope and blindfold the children
and let them see which one can break it;
then they all scramble for the contents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed, and Peggy added, &ldquo;Sounds
like a lot of fun. What&rsquo;re we going to decorate
the <i>olla</i> with?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I can think of is to cut some
colored pictures out of magazines and paste them
on it. Can you think of anything better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls shook their heads.</p>
<p>Soon the three had selected the brightest advertisements
from some magazines and had decorated
the jar till it looked quite festive.</p>
<p>That afternoon, before they had finished their
siestas, the guests began to arrive. First were the
children from the goat ranch with their mother;
then shortly afterwards Mar&iacute;a and the grandmother
with their line of little stairsteps.</p>
<p>Jo Ann noticed at once that Carlitos was missing
and asked Florence to inquire about him.</p>
<p>A moment later Florence explained to Jo Ann
that Carlitos had gone up on the mountain with
Jos&eacute; to get the charcoal. &ldquo;Mar&iacute;a says they&rsquo;ll be
down later&mdash;they&rsquo;ll stop on their way down with
the charcoal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait to have the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i> game till Carlitos
gets here,&rdquo; Jo Ann suggested to Florence. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want him to miss that. Let&rsquo;s show them how
to play some simple game like drop the handkerchief
while we&rsquo;re waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled dubiously. &ldquo;We can try it,
but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ve never played it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of their strenuous efforts to start the
game, they failed, as the children merely stared
timidly with their big black eyes, not seeming
to know how to enter into the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the quietest children I&rsquo;ve ever seen
in all my life,&rdquo; Jo Ann declared. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they
ever play, Florence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very seldom. They work most of the time.
The older ones take care of the babies and help
their mothers. I believe we&rsquo;d better go ahead
with the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>. It&rsquo;ll take them a long time to
break the <i>olla</i>, and maybe Carlitos&rsquo;ll be here
before anyone succeeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence blindfolded the largest one of the
little girls and handed her a stick, then turned
her around several times. &ldquo;Now see if you can
break the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>The girl took a few steps, then timidly struck
out with her stick, only to miss the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i> by several
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; called Pepito. &ldquo;Go
closer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence smiled. &ldquo;No, she gets only one turn
this time. You come on, Pepito, and try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his black eyes shining Pepito stepped
forward to be blindfolded. Jo Ann was delighted
to see how much stronger he seemed to be and
was as pleased as he when he hit the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>, even
though he did not succeed in breaking it.</p>
<p>Jo Ann and Peggy clapped their hands in applause,
and the little Mexican children, thinking
that was part of the game, timidly followed
their example.</p>
<p>Before all of the children had had a turn in
trying to hit the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>, Carlitos came running
up to the porch, his hands and face streaked with
the black charcoal dust.</p>
<p>Pepito pointed up to the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>. &ldquo;Look, Carlitos,
a <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>! And I hit it!&rdquo; He went on rapidly
to explain about the game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>With the keenest interest the three girls
watched Carlitos&rsquo; face brighten and his blue eyes
sparkle bluer than ever against the black of his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break it for you, Pepito,&rdquo; he replied confidently.</p>
<p>Peggy turned to Jo Ann and Florence, smiling.
&ldquo;Say, Jo, your little blue-eyed Mexican
seems to have turned into a little nigger. Don&rsquo;t
you think you&rsquo;d better introduce him to some
soap and water before the refreshments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Florence replied. &ldquo;Jo, take
him back and show him how to use the soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes stretched to their widest. &ldquo;Show
him how to use soap! What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably never seen toilet soap before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious! To think of an American boy living
like that&mdash;not even having seen toilet soap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After she had demonstrated to Carlitos how to
wash his hands with soap, she watched almost
unbelievingly his evident delight in the white
foamy suds and its magic effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get that boy back to civilization.
Something must be done right away,&rdquo; she told
herself.</p>
<p>As soon as he had finished, they hurried back
to the porch, and Florence placed the blindfold
on Carlitos. As he started toward the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>
Pepito called eagerly, &ldquo;Hit it hard, Carlitos&mdash;very
hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With almost uncanny accuracy, Carlitos
neared the <i>pi&ntilde;ata</i>, then struck out vigorously.</p>
<p>There was a crashing sound as the pottery vessel
cracked open and the contents scattered over
the floor.</p>
<p>Carlitos jerked the blindfold off, while the
children uttered little squeals of mingled excitement
and delight.</p>
<p>Smiling, Florence pointed to the scattered
sweets. &ldquo;Go get them!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The children needed no more urging.
Straightway they began scurrying about, their
black eyes shining with delight as they picked
up the candy and cakes and tasted them. With
their usual unselfishness they took some of them
over to their mothers and the grandmother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>Just then Jo Ann noticed Jos&eacute; leaning against
a near-by tree, a pleased expression on his face
as he watched the children&rsquo;s fun. &ldquo;Come on and
get some <i>dulces</i>,&rdquo; she called to him.</p>
<p>Smiling, he came over to the porch and took
the sweets Jo Ann offered.</p>
<p>While both the older people and the children
were enjoying the treat, Jo Ann went out to examine
the huge bags of charcoal that almost
completely covered the small burro. She laughed
aloud as she noticed that only his ears and his
feet were visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that charcoal&rsquo;s light, or that
burro&rsquo;d never be able to get to town with that
load,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>When she went back to the porch she told
Jos&eacute;, chiefly by gestures, that she was glad he
had made so much charcoal. &ldquo;When are you
going to take it to the village to sell?&rdquo; she asked
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ma&ntilde;ana</i> in the <i>ma&ntilde;ana</i>,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means early in the morning, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
she asked Florence.</p>
<p>Florence nodded.</p>
<p>Jo Ann put her hand on Carlitos&rsquo; shoulder.
&ldquo;Are the boys going with you, Jos&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; shook his head. &ldquo;No, I think it better that
they do not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after the children had finished eating
their refreshments, each one politely thanked the
girls and offered a grimy, sticky little hand in a
farewell shake.</p>
<p>As Mar&iacute;a was leaving with her family she remarked
to Florence again, &ldquo;You have much
kindness, se&ntilde;oritas&mdash;like Carlitos&rsquo; <i>mam&aacute;</i>. I have
much joy that he has friends <i>Americanos</i> now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had all left Jo Ann said determinedly,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve simply got to find Carlitos&rsquo; relatives
right away. Mar&iacute;a and Jos&eacute; are as kind to
him as they can be&mdash;they treat him as if he were
their own child&mdash;but they&rsquo;re so pitifully poor
and ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Florence shook her head dubiously. &ldquo;I wish
we could find some of his relatives, but it looks
as if we&rsquo;re up against a stone wall now. We&rsquo;ve
done everything we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo&rsquo;ll solve the mystery&mdash;she&rsquo;ll climb
right over the stone wall,&rdquo; laughed Peggy. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
great on climbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day, when the girls were busily preparing
dinner on the outdoor fireplace, Jo Ann
happened to glance down the road. &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo;
she exclaimed. &ldquo;Is that Pepito, running
like that? It is! Why, he oughtn&rsquo;t to run like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rushed out to meet him. &ldquo;No, no, Pepito!
You mustn&rsquo;t run like that,&rdquo; she called to him.</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, Pepito ejaculated, &ldquo;Carlitos!
Oh, Carlitos!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">&ldquo;CARLITOS&mdash;GONE!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Before Jo Ann could ask any more questions
Florence and Peggy came flying out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Pepito?&rdquo; Florence asked
quickly. &ldquo;Why were you running so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Car&mdash;li&mdash;tos&mdash;gone!&rdquo; he panted, his eyes
filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Florence repeated. She wheeled
about. &ldquo;Girls, he says Carlitos is gone&mdash;lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back. &ldquo;How could he be lost?
What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing how exhausted Pepito was from
running, Florence led him up to the porch and
made him sit down. &ldquo;Rest a few minutes, then
tell me what&rsquo;s happened,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>After he had partially regained his breath, he
began telling between sobs that Carlitos and the
burro had been stolen. Carlitos, he said, had
begged Jos&eacute; to let him go to town to help sell the
charcoal and that while there both he and the
burro had disappeared.</p>
<p>Florence rapidly translated his broken story
to the impatient girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carlitos stolen!&rdquo; Jo Ann repeated, puzzled.
&ldquo;Does he mean kidnaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like it.&rdquo; Florence began questioning
Pepito again. &ldquo;Where is your <i>pap&aacute;</i> now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the cave. When <i>mi pap&aacute;</i> tell us that Carlitos
is lost, I come to you. You can help us find
Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence repeated his words to the girls, saying,
&ldquo;Poor child, he thinks we can help them
because we did before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to help,&rdquo; Jo Ann spoke up emphatically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find Carlitos. Let&rsquo;s go
down to the cave right now and talk to Jos&eacute; and
find out exactly what&rsquo;s happened. Tell Pepito to
stay here and rest while we go to the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>When Florence suggested to him that he stay
and rest, Pepito shook his head. &ldquo;No, no, se&ntilde;orita.
I go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before starting to the cave Florence ran inside
to tell her mother what had happened.
&ldquo;Peggy says she&rsquo;ll stay and finish getting dinner
while Jo and I go down and find out the details
from Jos&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; her mother replied. &ldquo;I hope
they&rsquo;ll be able to find Carlitos before night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Florence came back, Jo Ann was
hurrying down the trail, Pepito following. Suddenly
realizing that Pepito must not walk so rapidly,
Jo Ann checked her pace, although she
could hardly wait to find out from Jos&eacute; what had
really happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible that Carlitos has
been kidnaped,&rdquo; she thought anxiously. &ldquo;That
mean mine boss tried to get him once&mdash;maybe
he&rsquo;s had something to do with his disappearance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>Just then Florence caught up with her and
began talking over this new trouble. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to do something to help find Carlitos, Jo. Had it
occurred to you that that mean boss might&rsquo;ve
had a hand in his disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann nodded. &ldquo;I was just thinking that very
same thing. The fact that Carlitos is the rightful
owner of the mine would give him a reason for
wanting to get him out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds terrible,&rdquo; Florence shuddered,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s possible, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they neared the cave, the girls could hear
the mother and grandmother talking rapidly in
shrill excited voices. On entering they saw Jos&eacute;
crouched disconsolately in a corner, his face
buried in his hands.</p>
<p>They stepped across to his side, and Florence
began quickly, &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, Pepito has told us about
Carlitos. Tell us all about what happened to him&mdash;how
he disappeared&mdash;and where you saw him
last. Maybe we can help you find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; raised his head, his dark troubled eyes
lighting a little at sight of the two girls who had
helped to save his son&rsquo;s life only a few days before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <i>Pap&aacute;</i>,&rdquo; put in Mar&iacute;a just then. &ldquo;The
se&ntilde;oritas&mdash;our friends&mdash;they will help us find
Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope we&rsquo;ll be able to help,&rdquo; Florence
told them earnestly.</p>
<p>Brokenly then Jos&eacute; began by telling how after
several efforts he had succeeded in selling only
a few <i>centavos&rsquo;</i> worth of the charcoal, and so he
decided to exchange some of it for food. Leaving
Carlitos outside to watch the burro, he had
gone into the little general store of the village.
After he had bargained with the storekeeper to
exchange corn, <i>frijoles</i> and coffee for a bag of
charcoal, he had hurried out to get it.</p>
<p>To his amazement Carlitos and the burro were
not in sight. Thinking they might have wandered
down the street, he started off to look for
them. They were nowhere to be seen, and after
he had searched in vain all over the few streets
of the village, he was in despair. Finally, after
inquiring of several people, he found a man who
said he&rsquo;d seen a boy and a man go by driving a
burro&mdash;only there were no bags of charcoal on
the burro.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I search much then, but I cannot find Carlitos
or the burro,&rdquo; he ended sorrowfully. &ldquo;I
have much fear that harm has come to Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Jos&eacute; had stopped talking, Florence
translated his story to Jo Ann.</p>
<p>When she reached the part about the man&rsquo;s
having seen a boy and a man driving a burro
without any charcoal, Jo Ann spoke up quickly,
&ldquo;Maybe that boy was Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned back to Jos&eacute;. &ldquo;Do you suppose
that boy was Carlitos who was helping to
drive the burro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; shook his head. &ldquo;No, no. The man say
this boy hit much the burro. Carlitos no hit our
burro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann, who had caught the meaning of Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s
words, put in, &ldquo;Florence, maybe the man was
making the boy hit the burro so he could hurry
him out of the village. He probably wanted the
burro too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>When Florence translated this idea to Jos&eacute;,
he replied, &ldquo;I thought of that too. I try to find
them, but it was impossible. I hunt for many
hours, but I find nothing.&rdquo; He shook his head
mournfully. &ldquo;Carlitos gone&mdash;the burro gone&mdash;the
charcoal gone&mdash;no have money to buy food
for my children. Ah <i>Dios</i>, it is terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s that man from the mine who&rsquo;s
back of it all,&rdquo; Jo Ann declared again. &ldquo;He
could easily have taken the charcoal off the burro
and hidden it, and have frightened Carlitos into
going with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed Florence. &ldquo;He might&rsquo;ve
forced him to go at the point of a gun. That mean
boss wouldn&rsquo;t stop at anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must do something about it right
now. Let&rsquo;s go to the village and see if we can&rsquo;t
find out more about that man and boy. Will your
mother let us go to the village with Jos&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure she will. It&rsquo;s not so far there.&rdquo;
She turned to Jos&eacute; and said, &ldquo;We want you to
go back to the village with us and see if we can
find out something more about Carlitos. Go to
the goat ranch and tell Juan to let us have two
burros. We&rsquo;ll go up to the house to tell my
mother and then meet you at the cart road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; nodded assent. &ldquo;<i>Bien</i>, se&ntilde;orita, I go immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls hurried up to the house, and Florence
quickly explained their plans to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;ll be all right for you to go,&rdquo; Mrs.
Blackwell replied. &ldquo;I hope you can find Carlitos,
but be very careful. That man is probably
capable of doing anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Blackwell, he can&rsquo;t be more dangerous
than that bear,&rdquo; put in Jo Ann. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
careful. I believe I&rsquo;ll take the gun along. I&rsquo;ll feel
safer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s take the pistol instead,&rdquo; Florence
put in. &ldquo;The gun&rsquo;s too heavy.&rdquo; She took a pistol
out of her bag and handed it to Jo Ann, then they
set off down the trail and a little later found
Jos&eacute; at the road waiting for them with the burros.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Jo Ann hesitated a moment before getting on
her burro. &ldquo;This is my first experience riding
without a saddle or a bridle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy after you get used to it,&rdquo; Florence
encouraged. &ldquo;You guide a burro, you
know, by hitting him on the neck with a stick.&rdquo;
She sprang up nimbly onto the pack on the donkey&rsquo;s
back.</p>
<p>After Jo Ann had mounted on her burro she
remarked, smiling, &ldquo;This burro&rsquo;s so small and
my legs&rsquo;re so long that they almost drag on the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit farther back, the way the Mexicans do,&rdquo;
Florence called back. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much easier riding
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; followed, walking closely behind Jo Ann,
having no difficulty in keeping up with the donkey&rsquo;s
pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any way to make these animals go
faster?&rdquo; Jo Ann called to Florence impatiently
a few minutes later.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll trot a little ways, but they really make
as good time by keeping their steady pace. Remember
you&rsquo;re in Mexico, Jo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the three had reached the village,
Jos&eacute; took the girls to the store in front of which
he had left Carlitos and the charcoal-laden burro
a few hours before. &ldquo;I know this storekeeper,&rdquo;
Florence told Jo Ann. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably know if
any strangers have been in the village lately. His
store&rsquo;s a meeting place for everybody in the village,
and he hears all the gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went inside and began questioning the
storekeeper. &ldquo;Have you heard of any strangers
being in the village in the last day or two besides
this man?&rdquo; She pointed to Jos&eacute;.</p>
<p>The storekeeper nodded his head, &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita.
I saw a man this morning that I have never
seen before. He bought some cigarettes from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he come in before this man&mdash;Jos&eacute;&mdash;did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;.</i> He said he was looking for a family that
had lived at a mining camp across the mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Florence gave a little start. &ldquo;Did he say why
he wanted to find this family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say they were his friends.&rdquo; The storekeeper
shrugged his shoulders Mexican fashion
and added, &ldquo;I tell him I know nothing, and then
he leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence hurriedly recounted this information
to Jo Ann, ending indignantly, &ldquo;I believe that
man was either the mean boss or someone he&rsquo;d
sent to get Carlitos. Jos&eacute; knows what the boss
looks like, so we can find out if the stranger was
he.&rdquo; She wheeled around to Jos&eacute; and asked,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;d that mean boss look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fat.&rdquo; Jos&eacute; gestured with his hands to
indicate a Santa Claus figure, then twisted an
imaginary mustache, adding, &ldquo;and a big black
mustache.&rdquo; He turned to the storekeeper. &ldquo;Did
that man look like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storekeeper shook his head. &ldquo;No. He very
small&mdash;no mustache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s not the boss,&rdquo; exclaimed Jo Ann.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am, too,&rdquo; Florence agreed. She turned to
Jos&eacute; and said, &ldquo;Take us down the street now
where that man you talked to said he saw the
strange man and the boy driving the burro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Jos&eacute; was guiding them to this street
which led to the outskirts of the village, Florence
caught sight of a familiar figure standing
in an open doorway. &ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman I know. I&rsquo;ll ask if
she saw them pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence hurried across the street and began
explaining to the woman about their search for
Carlitos and the burro. &ldquo;Have you seen anybody
of his description or heard anything about
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence&rsquo;s face fell. &ldquo;Well, have you heard
about anyone&rsquo;s finding any bags of charcoal?
This boy&rsquo;s burro was carrying two bags of charcoal
when he came to the village.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s black eyes lit with interest. &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>,
se&ntilde;orita. Adela, the woman who lives at the
corner, told me she had found two bags of charcoal
in her yard this morning. She did not know
how they got there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take us to her house and ask her to
let us see the bags of charcoal? This man&rdquo;&mdash;she
nodded over at Jos&eacute;&mdash;&ldquo;will know if they&rsquo;re his
bags. His mother made them herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman readily agreed to go with them,
and in a few minutes they were shown the bags
of charcoal.</p>
<p>A gleam of recognition immediately shone in
Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita. These are the bags
made by my mother.&rdquo; His voice changed to a
mournful note. &ldquo;That boy was Carlitos. That
man was making him beat the burro&mdash;he throw
this charcoal over the wall. He very bad
<i>hombre</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann, who had caught the meaning of Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s
words, put in quickly, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find that
man and get Carlitos away from him. There&rsquo;s
no telling what he&rsquo;ll do to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Jos&eacute; said he followed him for some distance
out this way.&rdquo; Florence wheeled about.
&ldquo;Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;which direction do you go
to get to that mine you came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You follow this road.&rdquo; He gestured toward
the winding road leading across the valley to the
range of mountains.</p>
<p>Jo Ann spoke up impatiently, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start
after Carlitos this minute. If we could find some
horses to ride, we could overtake that man and
Carlitos even if they did have several hours&rsquo;
start. That man wouldn&rsquo;t have taken the burro
if he hadn&rsquo;t intended using it. I know he can&rsquo;t
be traveling fast with a burro along. Come on,
let&rsquo;s see if we can find some horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get some horses here, I&rsquo;m sure. Dad
always gets his horse here when he comes to see
us&mdash;a burro&rsquo;s too slow for him.&rdquo; Florence
stopped a moment, then added hastily, &ldquo;I believe
I&rsquo;ll call Dad&mdash;I can phone to him from
here&mdash;and tell him what&rsquo;s happened and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence,&rdquo; Jo Ann broke in, &ldquo;ask him if
we can&rsquo;t go straight on to the mine. Tell him
we&rsquo;ll take Jos&eacute; with us, and tell him if we don&rsquo;t
follow that man and Carlitos at once we&rsquo;ll never
see Carlitos again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right. Come on. We&rsquo;ll go back to
the store&mdash;that&rsquo;s where the only telephone in the
village is. Come on, Jos&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">ON A DANGEROUS TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>As Florence led the way back to the store, she
told Jos&eacute; of their plans to get the horses and follow
the man and Carlitos. &ldquo;Can you guide us
across the mountains to the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita, I <i>sabe</i>. I take you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later the three were back at
the store, and Florence had succeeded in getting
her father on the telephone. It was anything
but easy for her to make him understand at first
about Carlitos&rsquo; disappearance and their desire
to hunt for him. When she finally made the
situation clear, a note of excitement came into
his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve phoned,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;because
I&rsquo;ve just got in touch with a man by the
name of Eldridge who, I believe, is Carlitos&rsquo;
uncle. Ask Jos&eacute; again the name of that mine
Carlitos&rsquo; father owned, and get him to tell you
as nearly as possible where it is. I want to be
sure that that is the mine and Carlitos the boy
that this man Eldridge has been hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence quickly turned to Jos&eacute;. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
say the name of the mine was La Esperanza?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me again how you get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With many gestures Jos&eacute; told her as nearly as
he could where the mine was located. &ldquo;Over that
mountain to the east,&rdquo; he kept saying, pointing
to the range beyond.</p>
<p>As soon as Florence repeated Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s answer to
her father, he replied that he would telegraph
at once to Mr. Eldridge. The name and location
of the mine, he said, corresponded with what he
had told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Daddy,&rdquo; Florence put in, in a pleading
tone, &ldquo;if we don&rsquo;t find Carlitos right away I&rsquo;m
afraid it&rsquo;ll be too late. We&rsquo;re afraid that mean
boss&rsquo;ll do something terrible to him&mdash;maybe
kill him. We&rsquo;re sure the boss is back of this kidnaping.
The reason Jos&eacute; left the mine was to
keep that man from getting Carlitos. We must
go right now and hunt for him. We know the
kidnaper has started toward the mine with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell your father if we get horses we&rsquo;re sure
we can overtake the man and Carlitos, because
they had only a burro,&rdquo; burst out Jo Ann
eagerly.</p>
<p>Florence nodded and repeated her words over
the telephone.</p>
<p>After a momentary silence Dr. Blackwell answered
slowly, &ldquo;Well, as soon as I send the telegram
to Mr. Eldridge, I&rsquo;ll start for the mine
too. I&rsquo;m sure I can get there before you do, as
I&rsquo;ve found an Indian guide who knows where it
is. I want to be there before you arrive, in case
any trouble should come up. I can&rsquo;t have you
girls risking your necks, even to save Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ll be there!&rdquo; Florence
replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Jo Ann&rsquo;s eyes shone as she heard Florence&rsquo;s
answer. She knew that meant that they could
start following the kidnaper and Carlitos right
away. As soon as Florence put up the receiver,
she caught her by the hand, saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hurry
as fast&rsquo;s we can and get the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. I&rsquo;ve got to write a note to Mother
first and give it to the man who brings our mail.
He can take the burros back to Juan, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Florence was still speaking, Jo Ann began
looking about impatiently for some paper.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get used to stores not having wrapping
paper as they do back home,&rdquo; she said. A few
moments later the storekeeper unearthed a scrap
of soiled brown paper and proudly handed it to
Florence.</p>
<p>She hastily scratched a few lines to her
mother, explaining the situation and the new
plan.</p>
<p>To Jo Ann&rsquo;s annoyance a half hour passed before
they could find the man who carried the
mail and arrange to get the horses and everything
else they needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>When, at last, they were actually mounted on
the horses and had started off down the road,
Jo Ann gave a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Thank goodness
we&rsquo;re on the way at last. Let&rsquo;s ride fast now, because
we&rsquo;ll have to slow down when we reach
the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tapped her horse sharply on his neck with
her switch, and off she galloped, Florence and
Jos&eacute; following closely.</p>
<p>When they reached the foot of the mountain,
Florence called to Jo Ann, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to let
Jos&eacute; lead the way from now on. He says we
leave the road here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly Jo Ann checked her
horse&rsquo;s pace to allow Jos&eacute; to lead. Slowly and
in single file they began winding their way up
a rocky trail. After about an hour&rsquo;s climb it became
so steep and narrow that even Jo Ann, experienced
rider that she was, began to grow
nervous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>With the towering wall of rock on her right
and the deep canyon below, she realized that if
her horse should make a single misstep it might
be fatal. She shuddered at the thought of how
easy it would be for the kidnaper to make away
with Carlitos in such a place as this. One little
push would mean death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she called back, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking
how easy it&rsquo;d be to make away with anyone
in such a wild, lonesome spot. You don&rsquo;t think
that man&rsquo;d push Carlitos off this precipice, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; Florence called back quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure he&rsquo;ll take him on to the mine. That mean
boss wouldn&rsquo;t pay him a large sum of money till
he was sure he had the right boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; Encouraged by Florence&rsquo;s
words, Jo Ann rode on in better spirits.
&ldquo;If that kidnaper takes Carlitos clear to the
mine, then we&rsquo;ll be sure to overtake them,&rdquo; she
thought.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, as the horses were
struggling up an unusually steep place, Jo Ann
suddenly cried out a sharp, &ldquo;Jos&eacute;, stop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Startled, Jos&eacute; checked his horse and looked
back.</p>
<p>Jo Ann pointed down at a boy&rsquo;s hat caught on
a sharp point of rock jutting out from the edge
of the cliff. &ldquo;See! Carlitos&rsquo; hat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ay Dios!</i> I have fear that it is the hat of
Carlitos.&rdquo; He leaped off his horse and began
hunting about for a stick with which to reach
the hat. Finally, having found a long stick, he
leaned over as far as he dared and carefully
worked the stick up under the frayed edge of the
hat. Both girls sprang off their horses to watch
his efforts.</p>
<p>When at last he had the hat in his hands, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;<i>Dios mio!</i> It is his hat!&rdquo; He pointed
to the cord around the crown. &ldquo;The grandmother
made this cord for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann suddenly gasped and pointed down
into the abyss-like gorge. &ldquo;Oh, Jos&eacute;, do you think
Carlitos&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off in the middle of her
sentence, shuddering at the thought of Carlitos
hurled down over the jagged rocks to the bottom
of the gorge hundreds of feet below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Florence broke in quickly, &ldquo;Maybe his hat
just blew off. If he had fallen over, we ought to
be able to see some sign of loosened rocks or
broken bushes where he slipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She and Jo Ann, as well as Jos&eacute;, began searching
for some sign along the edge of the precipice.
After a few moments Jo Ann walked up
the trail a short distance and, leaning over, examined
the path.</p>
<p>All at once her face lit. &ldquo;Florence! Jos&eacute;!
Come here&mdash;look!&rdquo; she called.</p>
<p>At the joyous note in Jo Ann&rsquo;s voice both
Florence and Jos&eacute; came up to her side and
stared down at the footprints in the limestone
dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These small prints were
made by Carlitos&rsquo; bare feet. They&rsquo;re just his
size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; agreed. He pointed to some
larger footprints beside them. &ldquo;And these are
made by the sandals of the man who is taking
him off. And here&rsquo;re the burro&rsquo;s marks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>Both Jo Ann and Florence drew deep sighs of
relief. &ldquo;I feel more certain than ever now that
the man&rsquo;ll take him clear to the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next moment Jo Ann frowned and
pointed to the ground a few feet ahead. &ldquo;That
rascal made Carlitos get off the burro so he
could ride. See! There&rsquo;re no signs of his footprints
from there on&mdash;just Carlitos&rsquo; and the
burro&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;I
wonder if it&rsquo;s very far to the mine now.&rdquo; She
turned to Jos&eacute;, &ldquo;How much farther is it to the
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three or four more hours and we&rsquo;ll be
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was that far. Why, it&rsquo;ll be
dark before we get there.&rdquo; There was a note of
anxiety in Florence&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Jo Ann shivered. &ldquo;How in the world will we
ever get over this trail in the dark? It&rsquo;s scary
enough in the daylight. Let&rsquo;s hurry and get going.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>Soon all three were on their horses again and
climbing steadily upward. After they had ridden
about an hour, the trail began to drop downward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;ew!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ridden
horses in lots of places, but nothing like this
toboggan slide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as she was finishing this sentence, Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s
horse dropped back on his haunches, his four
feet braced together, and began sliding in the
loose gravel of the almost perpendicular incline.</p>
<p>Both girls caught their breath.</p>
<p>The next moment Jo Ann felt her horse begin
to slide. A feeling of horror overwhelmed her.
She realized that she had no control over him
whatsoever. Would her horse and Florence&rsquo;s be
able to keep from slipping over the edge of that
horrible precipice?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A STARTLING CRY</span></h2>
<p>It seemed to Jo Ann that years passed before
her horse came to a stop. She drew a quick
breath of relief, then turned about quickly to
see if Florence were safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; she ejaculated as she saw
that Florence&rsquo;s horse, though still slipping, was
over the worst of the incline, and that Florence
was hanging on pluckily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;oh, Jos&eacute;!&rdquo; Jo Ann ejaculated. &ldquo;This is
terrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; agreed, watching Florence anxiously.</p>
<p>Shortly after Florence&rsquo;s horse had come to a
safe halt, she called out between gasps, &ldquo;Jos&eacute;&mdash;are
there&mdash;any more&mdash;places&mdash;this bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;orita. This is the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>In spite of the fact that their horses were getting
tired they urged them on, as darkness was
beginning to settle down over the mountains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought surely we&rsquo;d have caught up with
Carlitos and that man by this time,&rdquo; thought Jo
Ann. &ldquo;The poor child must be nearly dead,
walking so fast. I&rsquo;m tired, and we&rsquo;ve been riding
all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she saw how swiftly the shadows were
deepening, she wondered how they would ever
be able to follow the trail from now on. But
they must.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that mean boss ever gets his hands on
Carlitos, that&rsquo;ll be the last we&rsquo;ll ever see of
him,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That boss wants to keep the
mine, and he won&rsquo;t stop at anything to have his
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After they had ridden for about an hour, the
darkness grew so thick that it was almost impenetrable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Jo Ann called back in a low anxious voice to
Florence, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a thing&mdash;it&rsquo;s so black. I&rsquo;m
glad, though, the trail&rsquo;s not so dangerous along
here. It must be almost time for the moon to be
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is,&rdquo; Florence answered, then
called to Jos&eacute;, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it time for the moon to
come up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;</i>, se&ntilde;orita, but I have much fear there will
be no moon tonight. I think there will be a
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he was speaking the girls saw a flash
of lightning and heard the distant rumbling of
thunder. A few moments later great drops of
rain began to pelt into their faces as a gust of
wind blew against them. With almost incredible
swiftness the storm broke in all its fury. Blinding
flashes of lightning darted in every direction,
deafening rolls of thunder echoed and re-echoed
over the mountains.</p>
<p>Never had Jo Ann heard such thunder&mdash;it
growled and raged like some horrible monster.
The rain began sweeping down in torrents, lashing
them furiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>In a brilliant flash of lightning Jo Ann was
horrified to see streams of water rushing down
the mountain side carrying stones and debris.
She realized at once that they were in grave
danger.</p>
<p>The next moment Jos&eacute; was beside her. Without
a word he caught her horse&rsquo;s bridle and began
leading him over the treacherous, slippery
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Florence coming&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but her
words were drowned by the storm.</p>
<p>In a few more moments Jos&eacute; turned off the
trail and started leading the horse almost
straight up the rocky mountain side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;where are you going?&rdquo; Jo Ann
gasped, unheard.</p>
<p>When her horse had climbed a little farther,
lightning illuminated the darkness enough to
show her an overhanging ledge of rock jutting
out just ahead of them.</p>
<p>Instantly she grasped Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s plan. Here was a
shelter&mdash;a refuge from the storm!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>As soon as he had led her up under the cliff
she sprang off her horse, crying, &ldquo;Get Florence!
Hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&iacute;, s&iacute;</i>,&rdquo; he nodded.</p>
<p>With that Jos&eacute; was off again down the trail.
After what seemed to Jo Ann an endless time, he
reappeared leading Florence&rsquo;s horse and his own.</p>
<p>The moment Florence leaped off her horse Jo
Ann caught her in a warm embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Florence, I&rsquo;m so thankful you&rsquo;re safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m thankful we&rsquo;re all safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had Carlitos here with us, too!
Oh, Florence, where do you suppose he is now?
He might get washed off the trail if that man
forces him on in this storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that kidnaper&rsquo;ll do exactly what
Jos&eacute; is doing&mdash;seek refuge till the storm checks,&rdquo;
Florence comforted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. He and Carlitos might be under
just such a rocky ledge as this right now. What
puzzles me is how they could&rsquo;ve got this far
without our overtaking them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>As soon as Jos&eacute; had tied the horses to some
scrubby bushes he hurried over to Florence&rsquo;s
side and shouted, &ldquo;I go now to look for Carlitos.
We are getting near the mine, and I must find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jos&eacute;, the storm is terrible. Wait a little
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the rain had checked a little, Jos&eacute;
turned to Florence and said, &ldquo;Wait for me here,
<i>sabe</i>? I go now.&rdquo; With that he started off and
disappeared in the darkness once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he can just find Carlitos!&rdquo; Jo Ann said
wistfully.</p>
<p>She drew back hastily against the rocky wall
in an effort to escape a sudden gust of rain, as
did Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t as good a shelter as I thought,&rdquo;
Florence gasped. &ldquo;The wind&mdash;must be changing&mdash;to
another direction. It&rsquo;s cold, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is. Let&rsquo;s move over farther this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Keeping close to the wall they made their way
farther on around a sharp projecting rock,
which protected them a little better.</p>
<p>After they had stood there several minutes, an
unusually brilliant lightning flash lighted the
surrounding blackness long enough for them to
see that back to their right was what appeared
to be the opening of a cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a cave back there and we can get
in it, we&rsquo;ll be entirely out of the rain,&rdquo; Jo Ann
told herself as she wiped her rain-drenched face
on her sleeve.</p>
<p>When at last the thunder&rsquo;s reverberations
were beginning to die away, she leaned over
closer to Florence and said, &ldquo;Did you see that
cave-like opening back there on your right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on back and see if it is a cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no. There might be a bear&mdash;or some
other animal in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a sudden lull in the rain and thunder just
then a wailing sound floated to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Both girls uttered little gasps of fright.</p>
<p>That was the cry of a human being! The same
thought struck them&mdash;could that be Carlitos?</p>
<p>Jo Ann leaned over and whispered excitedly
in Florence&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;That sounds like Carlitos&rsquo;
voice. Do you think&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; She halted to listen
to the wailing notes again. &ldquo;I believe that is
Carlitos! It&rsquo;s a boy&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;it is. There probably wouldn&rsquo;t
be any other child up here in this wild place on
a night like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s slip up closer and see if we can tell
whether it&rsquo;s Carlitos. If it is, we&rsquo;ve got to get
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that man! We couldn&rsquo;t get Carlitos away
from him without Jos&eacute; to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann caught Florence&rsquo;s hand in hers.
&ldquo;Come on. Let&rsquo;s slip on up closer and see if we
can find out for sure if it&rsquo;s Carlitos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they stealthily crept along the wall
till they could see two figures crouched about a
small fire on the floor of the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Jo Ann squeezed Florence&rsquo;s hand tightly to
indicate to her that she had recognized Carlitos.
Quickly Florence returned the pressure, then
began pulling her backwards.</p>
<p>Jo Ann obediently turned, and silently the
two girls retraced their steps out of hearing distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get Carlitos away from that
man right away,&rdquo; Jo Ann whispered excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Jos&eacute; isn&rsquo;t here to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to wait for him. That man might
leave with Carlitos before he gets back. I&rsquo;m
going to get the rope and pistol out of the
saddle-bag, and we can capture that man ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Jo!&rdquo; Florence&rsquo;s voice was filled
with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you&rsquo;ll have to do&rsquo;ll be to hold the gun
on him while I tie him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jo! Let&rsquo;s wait for Jos&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You wait here while I get the things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Without waiting to hear Florence&rsquo;s whispered
protest, she hurried back to the horses and returned
with the pistol and rope.</p>
<p>As she handed Florence the pistol she whispered,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so excited you forget to throw
off the safety. As soon as I fix my rope, we&rsquo;ll be
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hastily tied a slipknot in the rope, then
ordered, &ldquo;Come on. Stay right behind me and
hold that gun on the man. We&rsquo;ll wait till it
thunders again, so he won&rsquo;t hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly and cautiously they slipped on toward the cave.
<a id="rfront" href="#front">Jo Ann could see that the man and Carlitos were still crouched around the fire.</a></p>
<p>When they had gone as close as they dared,
they waited till there was a loud crash of thunder.
Immediately Jo Ann crept forward till she
was directly behind the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>With amazing swiftness she dropped the
noose over the man&rsquo;s head and down over his
shoulders, then jerked back on the rope. Automatically
his hand flew toward his stiletto as he
leaped forward. But the rope tightened&mdash;his
arms were pinioned to his sides. He wheeled
partly around only to find he was looking into
the barrel of a 32-caliber automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still or I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rdquo; Florence ordered
in Spanish. &ldquo;Carlitos&mdash;get back. You might get
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann quickly slipped a loop of the rope
over the man&rsquo;s right hand and drew it behind his
back, then his left, and tied the two together
securely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to lie down on the ground now,&rdquo;
Jo Ann said.</p>
<p>Florence quickly repeated the order.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes blazed angrily. &ldquo;No&mdash;no. I
no&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His protest was lost in a clap of thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you&rsquo;re told or I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rdquo; Florence
commanded a moment later.</p>
<p>As the man made no move, Jo Ann quickly
gave him a hard shove and sent him sprawling
headlong on the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do what we tell you,&rdquo; she scolded in
English as she jerked the rope about his feet and
began tying them together. &ldquo;What do you mean
by running off with this little boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as she had finished tying him, she remarked
to Florence, &ldquo;Ask him where he&rsquo;s taking
Carlitos and what he was going to do with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as Florence had begun asking him these
questions, Carlitos suddenly cried out in terror
and pointed to the entrance.</p>
<p>The same instant Florence felt a strong hand
clutch her shoulder as the gun was snatched out
of her hand.</p>
<p>At Carlitos&rsquo; cry of terror Jo Ann&rsquo;s gaze
turned toward the cave entrance. Then cold fear
clutched her heart as she saw towering over
Florence a great hulk of a man with a long mustache
who she instinctively felt must be the mean
boss.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">PRISONERS</span></h2>
<p>Before Jo Ann could spring to her feet, Carlitos
was crouching behind her crying piteously,
&ldquo;<i>El jefe! El jefe!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann immediately recognized the name &ldquo;<i>el
jefe</i>&rdquo; as meaning the boss. She was right. That
man was the mean boss!</p>
<p>Just then the boss broke into a burst of coarse
derisive laughter that sent shivers down her
spine. &ldquo;Ah, the se&ntilde;oritas <i>muy bravo</i>! They bind
the peon who thinks he&rsquo;s a man but has not the
strength of a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Jo Ann that the boss&rsquo;s huge body
almost filled the narrow opening as he stood
there with Florence&rsquo;s gun aimed directly toward
them. What could she do now? How could they
save themselves and Carlitos? Oh, why hadn&rsquo;t
she taken Florence&rsquo;s advice and waited for Jos&eacute;
before coming in here! If only Jos&eacute; would come
now!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>A sudden idea flashed into her mind. When
the boss stooped over to untie the peon, maybe
she&rsquo;d have a chance to slip his gun out of his
holster; then she&rsquo;d watch her chance to take him
by surprise.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were broken into by the boss
seizing Florence roughly by the arm and starting
toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s my chance to get his gun,&rdquo; Jo Ann
thought, feeling sure that he was going to untie
the peon now.</p>
<p>To her consternation, instead of untying the
peon, he kicked him viciously and snarled, &ldquo;You
no good&mdash;you let the se&ntilde;oritas bind you up&mdash;now
I leave you here for the wild beasts to
gnaw on your bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Jo Ann could not understand all
that he said, she realized immediately that he
was going to leave the peon here to die. &ldquo;What
a beast that man is,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Get on out&mdash;all of you,&rdquo; the boss growled,
pushing Carlitos roughly in front of the girls
and pointing his gun menacingly.</p>
<p>When the peon saw them all starting out of
the cave, leaving him there alone, bound and
helpless, he began struggling and rolling about,
trying to free himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me here! You can&rsquo;t leave me! I
did what you told me. I brought the boy back.
Where is the money you promised me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wild animals cannot eat money,&rdquo; the
boss flung back, then laughed callously.</p>
<p>Jo Ann gasped in horror as she caught the
meaning of his cruel words. &ldquo;That man isn&rsquo;t
human. No wonder Jos&eacute; with his family had
fled from the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the peon&rsquo;s piteous cries ringing in their
ears the two girls silently walked on in front of
the boss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get on your horses&mdash;<i>pronto</i>,&rdquo; the
boss ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>As Carlitos whimpered softly, Jo Ann caught
hold of his hand to silence and comfort him.</p>
<p>Too terrified even to speak to each other, the
three stumbled along in the darkness around the
ledge. Instead of three horses, they found four.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must belong to the boss,&rdquo; Jo Ann
thought. &ldquo;I wonder if he has guessed that Jos&eacute;
came with us.&rdquo; She caught her breath as a new
fear overwhelmed her. Had he already found
Jos&eacute; and made away with him&mdash;pushed him
over the precipice, perhaps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, <i>pronto</i>!&rdquo; the boss growled.</p>
<p>In a brilliant flash of lightning Jo Ann saw
Carlitos struggling to reach the horn of his saddle.
She leaned over quickly and half lifted,
half pushed him up on the horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Infante!</i> Can you not ride without Pancho?&rdquo;
the boss growled tauntingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must think that the peon and Carlitos
came here on a horse,&rdquo; Jo Ann thought with a
feeling of relief, as she mounted one of the other
horses. &ldquo;That means he must not have seen Jos&eacute;
or know that he&rsquo;s with us. But where can Jos&eacute;
be now? Could he have slipped on the trail and
fallen over a precipice?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Andale&mdash;mas pronto!</i>&rdquo; ordered the gruff
voice again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a big hurry to get away from here,&rdquo;
thought Jo Ann. &ldquo;He evidently has some strong
reason for rushing us this way. I&rsquo;m going to delay
him in every way I can so Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;ll
be sure to be at the mine before we get there. If
he isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She shuddered at the thought
of what might happen to Florence, Carlitos,
and herself.</p>
<p>Just then the boss broke into such a rapid flow
of Spanish that Jo Ann could catch only a word
or two.</p>
<p>At his threats Florence shook so she could
hardly get on her horse. He would kill all of
them, he had said, if any one of them tried to
escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We no <i>sabe</i>,&rdquo; Jo Ann spoke up. &ldquo;We <i>Americanos</i>&mdash;no
<i>sabe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The emphasis Jo Ann had placed on the word
&ldquo;we&rdquo; made Florence understand at once that she
did not want her to let the man know that she
could speak or understand Spanish. Though she
could not guess Jo&rsquo;s reason, she decided to pretend
not to understand him.</p>
<p>Just as they were about to start off down to
the trail Jo Ann heard the faint but heartrending
cry of the deserted peon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose the boss should tie us and leave us
to die of thirst and starvation like that,&rdquo; she said
to herself. &ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s what he did to Carlitos&rsquo;
father, Jos&eacute; said no one knew what had become
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m first,&rdquo; she thought a moment
later. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll give me a better chance to delay
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On reaching the trail, she deliberately turned
her horse back in the direction from which they
had just come. That would delay them a little
bit.</p>
<p>The horses of both Carlitos and Florence followed
her lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>No sooner did the boss realize that they were
going in the wrong direction than he roared out
angrily, &ldquo;Wait! That&rsquo;s not the direction to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann paid no attention to this gruff command
but kept on.</p>
<p>A few moments later her horse was stopped
by being crowded against the rocky wall. Then
she felt her arm seized in a vise-like grip and
heard the boss&rsquo;s shouts in her ear. A flash of
lightning showed her his anger-contorted face
only a few inches from her own.</p>
<p>Though she was terrified, she controlled herself
enough to cry out, &ldquo;No <i>sabe</i>. No <i>sabe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make you <i>sabe</i>!&rdquo; He blocked the trail in
front of her with his horse, then leaped off and
grabbed her horse&rsquo;s bridle and turned him
around. As he struck him sharply with his quirt,
the animal leaped forward.</p>
<p>Instantly she realized the danger of pushing
one of the other horses off the narrow trail and
drew back on the reins in time to avert a disaster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>With Florence in the lead they set off toward
the mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I made him waste a little time,&rdquo; Jo
Ann thought, &ldquo;but if he finds out I&rsquo;m deliberately
trying to delay him there&rsquo;s no telling
what he&rsquo;ll do. He&rsquo;s the meanest man I ever
saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to an unusually slippery stretch
she could think only of the danger of riding on
the treacherous winding mountain trail in the
darkness. One thing lifted her flagging spirits.
The storm was abating&mdash;abating almost as rapidly
as it had begun. &ldquo;Now if only the moon&rsquo;ll
come up,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards she noted a light shining
from behind the fast-sailing storm clouds. Even
as she looked, the moon came into full view,
lighting up the mountain side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed to herself.
At least they could see where they were going
now. It would be safer traveling for Jos&eacute;, too.
But where was he? Would they meet him soon?
But if they did, what would the boss do to him?
He might treat him as badly as he had the peon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Even as she was wondering, Jos&eacute; was struggling
up a steep bank not far below the cave. In
his haste to get back to the girls he had, Indian
fashion, left the trail and had struck straight up
the mountain side, scaling almost perpendicular
rocks and pulling himself up by anything that
offered a finger hold.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the rocky ledge under
which he had left the girls and the horses, he
heard a wailing sound that made him stop as
rigid as if frozen. Who was that? What was the
matter? The se&ntilde;oritas! He must get to them at
once.</p>
<p>Cautiously but rapidly he crawled up to the
ledge. As soon as he saw there was no sign of the
girls or the horses there, his eyes widened in
horror. What had happened to them? That cry&mdash;but
that was a man&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>All at once it flashed through his mind that
it might be the very man he had been hunting.
Was Carlitos there with him? The se&ntilde;oritas&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Just then the cry, half wailing, half groaning,
sounded again.</p>
<p>Silently Jos&eacute; started in the direction of the
cry. That might be only a trap, and he must not
be caught.</p>
<p>When he neared the cave he saw through the
opening the dying embers of a fire. By its faint
glow he could make out the figure of a man
struggling and rolling about on the ground.</p>
<p>As soon as Jos&eacute; saw that the man was tied and
that there was no one else in the cave, he called
out, &ldquo;What is your trouble? Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s voice the man instantly
stopped struggling. &ldquo;Come and release me! Release
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; made no move to enter, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
he demanded again. &ldquo;Who tied you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two se&ntilde;oritas tie me up. Then that man take
them away&mdash;and leave me here to die. Release
me! I kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Immediately Jos&eacute; knew that this must be the
man who had stolen Carlitos. &ldquo;Where is the boy&mdash;Carlitos?
What have you done with him?&rdquo; he
demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>El jefe</i> take him. Release me and I go kill
<i>el jefe</i>. He no give me the money he promised.
And he leave me here for the animals to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he take the se&ntilde;oritas to the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&iacute;&mdash;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Jos&eacute; had asked him a few more questions
the man promised to show him a short cut
to the mine so they could overtake the boss and
his prisoners. &ldquo;I help you get the se&ntilde;oritas and
the boy.&rdquo; Convinced, finally, that the man was in
earnest, Jos&eacute; quickly untied the rope that bound
him and coiled it over his arm.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the two men set off together
down the steep, rocky mountain side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">A DARING PLAN</span></h2>
<p>In spite of all Jo Ann&rsquo;s efforts to slow their
progress down the trail, she met with little success.
Every time she slowed her horse the boss
would ride up close behind and strike her horse
with his quirt.</p>
<p>When the first faint rays of dawn were tingeing
the eastern sky, the boss suddenly ordered
them to stop. Pointing down into a dark ravine,
he indicated by signs that they were to leave the
trail and ride into it. Involuntarily Jo Ann
gasped. The steepness of the sharp descent terrified
her. Even more alarming was the thought
that this was the place where he had planned
to leave them as he had the peon back in the
cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>If Dr. Blackwell or Jos&eacute; should come along
this trail they never would think of hunting
down there for them. &ldquo;Unless I leave some clue
up here on the trail,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>When both Jo Ann and Florence kept repeating,
&ldquo;No <i>sabe</i>&mdash;no <i>sabe</i>,&rdquo; to all of his commands,
the boss, with an angry, &ldquo;Follow me, <i>pronto</i>,&rdquo;
started his horse down into the ravine. He
glanced over his shoulder to see if they were following.</p>
<p>In the short interval in which he was not
looking at them, Jo Ann jerked off her belt and
tossed it back on the trail. &ldquo;If Jos&eacute; or Dr. Blackwell
sees that, they&rsquo;ll search all around here,&rdquo;
she thought.</p>
<p>Slipping and sliding over sharp rocks and
scrubby mesquite bushes they finally succeeded
in reaching the bottom of the ravine.</p>
<p>After they had ridden some distance out of
sight of the trail, the boss leaped off his horse
and ordered them to follow his example.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>For an instant it seemed to Jo Ann that her
heart had stopped beating; then it began pounding
away so rapidly that she had difficulty in
breathing.</p>
<p>Was this to be the end? Was this silent dark
ravine the spot where Florence and Carlitos and
she were to be left to die?</p>
<p>As soon as they had all dismounted, the boss
gestured to them to take the saddles off their
horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No <i>sabe</i>&mdash;no <i>sabe</i>,&rdquo; Jo Ann began repeating.</p>
<p>The next instant the boss growled and raised
his quirt threateningly.</p>
<p>Without another protest she pulled the saddle
off and then helped Carlitos remove his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mas pronto</i>,&rdquo; the boss kept commanding.</p>
<p>As soon as they had removed the saddles, he
indicated some bushes near by under which they
were to hide them; that done, he had all
three tie their horses a little farther down the
ravine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s trying to cover up all trace of us,&rdquo; Jo
Ann thought, shaking. &ldquo;He must be going to
make away with us now. Poor Florence! Poor
Carlitos! What can I do? Isn&rsquo;t there something
I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To her amazement just then the boss gestured
to them to climb back up on the trail. What was
he going to do with them now? Where was he
taking them?</p>
<p>On reaching the trail he urged them on forward
as fast as they could walk. Not long afterward
they came to a little rise in the trail from
which they could see in the valley below a huge
white stone house outlined against the dark gray
background of the mountains. Involuntarily the
girls stopped to stare down at it in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d ever think of seeing such a palace as
that way out here!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed.</p>
<p>For once the boss forgot to urge them on. He
pointed down proudly to the house. &ldquo;My <i>casa</i>.
It cost me <i>mucho dinero</i>,&rdquo; he bragged, then gestured
to some tiny shacks on the mountain side.
&ldquo;I no live like the peons.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder he can have such a fine house,&rdquo;
Jo Ann thought. &ldquo;He stole the mine from
Carlitos&rsquo; father in the first place and makes the
peons live in little old shacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the boss had leaped off his horse
and had tied it to a near-by bush. He turned
back to the girls and Carlitos. &ldquo;Move along.
<i>Pronto!</i>&rdquo; he ordered, gesturing up to a narrow
path cut into the steep mountain side.</p>
<p>Jo Ann intuitively realized that this path led
to the mine. A feeling of terror swept over her
again. This must be the end! He was taking
them up to the mine to make away with them
there so no one would know what had become
of them. That was why he was hurrying them so
fast&mdash;so he&rsquo;d get rid of them before it was daylight
and the men came to work. What would
he do with them? If he left them bound as he
had the peon in the cave, some of the workmen
would be sure to find them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>A sudden thought flashed into her mind that
left her panic-stricken. In nearly all mines, she&rsquo;d
heard, there were old, deep unused shafts. Was
it possible that he was going to leave them in
one of those old shafts? If he did, no one in the
world would ever find a trace of them. She must
fight to the very last. There must be something
she could do. Dr. Blackwell&mdash;where was he?
He had said he would get here ahead of them.
He might be down there in the valley waiting
for them this very minute, she told herself.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached a spot in the
path directly above the house. &ldquo;One could
almost throw a stone down into the patio of that
house from here,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If I could only
attract the attention of someone down there. He
seems to be trying so hard to get us up here
without anyone&rsquo;s seeing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A daring plan darted into her mind. She&rsquo;d
risk the boss&rsquo;s anger. No matter what he did, it
could not be as bad as what awaited them at the
mine. The next instant she began to put this plan
into action.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>She stumbled and with a piercing shriek fell
prostrate, pushing several large stones over the
edge of the trail. As they rolled down the mountain
side, loosening other stones on their way,
they made a terrific crashing noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my foot! My foot!&rdquo; she groaned,
grabbing her ankle.</p>
<p>Florence was at her side the next moment.
&ldquo;Oh, Jo Ann! Are you hurt badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Jo Ann could answer, the boss was
standing over her, shaking his quirt threateningly.
&ldquo;What you mean? You make too much
noise. Move on&mdash;<i>pronto</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann shook her head, crying again, &ldquo;My
foot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he started to strike her with his quirt she
turned over and began crawling on hands and
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only Dr. Blackwell or someone heard
those rocks and would come to our rescue,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;My crawling this way will delay us
some. I wish, though, that I dared tell Florence
that I&rsquo;m not hurt. She&rsquo;s so worried because she
thinks I&rsquo;ve really sprained my ankle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Every few moments she kept looking back
toward the boss as an excuse to get a view of
the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, if Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s down there and
heard all that noise, he&rsquo;d look up here and see
us,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t see somebody soon,
I&rsquo;ll risk knocking some more stones over.&rdquo; She
slowed her crawling pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mas pronto!</i>&rdquo; came the growling command,
then she felt a sharp lick across her back. Only
her thick sweater kept her from being cut by
the boss&rsquo;s quirt.</p>
<p>In spite of this, she ventured to look around
again a few moments later. To her unbounded
relief she caught a glimpse of three men on
horses riding rapidly toward the foot of the
trail. They were not dressed like Indians, she
noticed. The rider ahead looked as if he might
be Dr. Blackwell. Oh, if only he were! If he
could only get to them right away. &ldquo;That black
hole up ahead on the path&mdash;that must be the
opening to the mine,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Just then Carlitos exclaimed in a frightened
voice, &ldquo;<i>La mina</i> [The mine]!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Terrified at the sight of this black yawning
hole so close above them, Jo Ann cried out
frantically, &ldquo;Florence, stop! Don&rsquo;t go any
farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her sharp command Florence halted,
white-faced and trembling. The next instant she
reached out to catch hold of Carlitos.</p>
<p>The boss burst forth in such a rapid flow of
Spanish that neither one of the girls could
understand a word. His face was so distorted
with rage that Florence and Carlitos huddled
together against the rocky wall, frozen with
fear.</p>
<p>As the boss raised his quirt to strike her, Jo
Ann caught a glimpse of a white-clothed man
stealthily slipping along the trail close behind
him. Instantly she recognized the man as Jos&eacute;.
&ldquo;I must keep the boss from knowing Jos&eacute; is behind
him,&rdquo; she thought quickly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t go on!&rdquo; she cried, and jumped
to her feet just in time to dodge a blow from
his quirt.</p>
<p>As he lurched forward to strike again, she
saw a coil of rope sail through the air and fall
over his head and shoulders. The next instant
his arms were pinioned to his sides.</p>
<p>Before the boss could realize what had happened,
Jos&eacute; and the peon sprang forward and
threw him down on the ground. With deft
fingers they bound him securely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">THE NEW HOPE MINE</span></h2>
<p>Everything had happened so quickly that
Florence and Carlitos were still standing
motionless by the wall.</p>
<p>While Jos&eacute; and the peon held the boss, Jo
Ann cautiously led Florence and Carlitos past
him. So fiercely was he roaring that shivers ran
down their spines.</p>
<p>Jo Ann scarcely drew a long breath till all
three of them were out of his reach. Even then
she was terrified for Jos&eacute; and the peon. Would
they be able to get him down that narrow trail
without danger to themselves?</p>
<p>A few moments later, as the three rounded a
curve, they saw Dr. Blackwell running up the
trail toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Daddy! Daddy!&rdquo; Florence cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>The next moment she was in her father&rsquo;s
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thankful I am that I&rsquo;ve found you girls
and Carlitos alive!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hugging her
tightly. &ldquo;I was frantic when I got here and
didn&rsquo;t find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that she realized that Dr. Blackwell
was here and they were all safe, Jo Ann felt
such a surge of weakness creep over her that she
leaned against the wall for support. Now she
could relax&mdash;all the responsibility was the doctor&rsquo;s
from now on.</p>
<p>Just then two other men came running up
the trail, one of them wearing the uniform of a
<i>rurale</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the officer to go up and help Jos&eacute; and
the peon,&rdquo; Florence told her father. &ldquo;They have
the mean boss tied, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so terrible&mdash;so savage, he&rsquo;s liable to escape
yet,&rdquo; Jo Ann put in. &ldquo;Tell him to hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>rurale</i> hurriedly slipped past them and
rushed on up the narrow trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>Dr. Blackwell now turned to the tall thin
man who had been standing quietly behind
him. &ldquo;Girls, this is Mr. Eldridge, Carlitos&rsquo;
uncle. He reached the village about the same
time I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned and in rapid Spanish explained
to Carlitos that this was his uncle.</p>
<p>Carlitos&rsquo; blue eyes widened in amazement.
&ldquo;My uncle!&rdquo; he repeated, gazing past them to
the tall man. Slowly then the boy edged around
the girls toward his uncle.</p>
<p>Mr. Eldridge reached out and took Carlitos&rsquo;
hand in his. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy&mdash;happy that I&rsquo;ve
found you at last,&rdquo; he said in English. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
searched for years for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlitos stared blankly, not understanding a
single word. Florence turned to Carlitos and
translated what his uncle had said.</p>
<p>Immediately Carlitos&rsquo; face began to brighten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems terrible that my own nephew can&rsquo;t
understand his native language,&rdquo; Mr. Eldridge
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better hurry on down off this narrow
trail,&rdquo; put in Dr. Blackwell. He turned around
and led the way down, the others following in
single file.</p>
<p>As soon as they neared the great white house,
Dr. Blackwell explained that they had better
go on inside and wait till the men brought the
boss down. &ldquo;Mr. Eldridge wants to question
him about Carlitos&rsquo; father and mother. There
are also several things about the mine he&rsquo;d like
to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the girls saw the three men bringing
the boss in, they slipped out into the patio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen all I want to of that terrible creature,&rdquo;
declared Jo Ann. &ldquo;I never want to lay
eyes on him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; agreed Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you thrilled over Carlitos&rsquo; finding his
uncle and his prospect of getting the mine back?
Just think how his life&rsquo;ll be changed now!
From poverty to comfort. And now he&rsquo;ll have
his uncle to look after him and see that he has
all the advantages he should.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as happy as can be over his good
fortune. And Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s and his family&rsquo;s, too, because
I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Eldridge&rsquo;ll help them for
taking care of Carlitos and saving his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were waiting, Jo Ann began to
gaze about, noticing the number of rooms, each
opening onto the patio. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a strange
place? And this is Carlitos&rsquo; house now. Some
contrast with the cave he&rsquo;s been living in, isn&rsquo;t
it? Let&rsquo;s take a look around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls walked down the corridor to
the first open door and peered in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; gasped Jo Ann. &ldquo;A grand piano!
What do you know about that! And look what&rsquo;s
tied to one of the legs&mdash;a fighting rooster!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, that man&rsquo;d be sure to have some
fighting roosters. Cock fighting&rsquo;s one of the
principal amusements down here. That&rsquo;s a
strange place to keep the rooster, though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>They wandered on down to the next open
door, and to Jo Ann&rsquo;s utter amazement there
was another piano with a rooster tied to one of
the legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I seeing double?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s typical of the peon. They&rsquo;re very fond
of music and of cock fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After going to three more rooms and finding
three more pianos and each with a rooster tied
to it, Jo Ann exclaimed, amazed, &ldquo;Is that man
crazy? That&rsquo;s the funniest thing I ever heard of
in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence was not nearly as surprised. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just his idea of wealth,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Those
are his most valued possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Dr. Blackwell stepped out in the
corridor and called to them to come to the office.
&ldquo;Mr. Eldridge wants to talk to you girls,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we won&rsquo;t see that mean boss again,&rdquo;
Jo Ann remarked as she and Florence started
to the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>On entering they glanced hurriedly about to
see if he were there.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell spoke up quickly. &ldquo;The men
have gone with their prisoner. They&rsquo;re taking
him on to the city to turn him over to the
authorities there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out anything about what happened
to Carlitos&rsquo; father before he left?&rdquo; Jo
Ann asked the doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the peon told us that he knew that the
boss had made away with him by pushing him
down into a deep unused shaft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s awful!&rdquo; Jo Ann exclaimed, a look of
horror in her eyes. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what he was
going to do with us, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we might be right now if you
hadn&rsquo;t come to our rescue, Dad,&rdquo; Florence
added. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t talk about it any more. I
can&rsquo;t bear to think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann caught her by the hand and led her
over to Carlitos&rsquo; side. &ldquo;Tell him how happy we
are that his uncle has found him at last.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>As soon as Florence had translated these
words to Carlitos, Mr. Eldridge moved over
closer to the three. &ldquo;If it had not been for you
girls, I never would have found my boy,&rdquo; he
said patting Carlitos&rsquo; shoulder affectionately.
&ldquo;You risked your lives for him, and I&rsquo;ll never
cease to be grateful to you. Since, with your
help, we&rsquo;ve got the mine back for Carlitos, we
want you to have a share in it. As soon as I get
back to the city I&rsquo;m going to send each of you
several shares of the stock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; Jo Ann cried. &ldquo;But we
really don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so good of you and Carlitos,&rdquo;
Florence added. She turned to Carlitos then and
told him how glad she and Jo Ann were to be
partners with him in his mine. &ldquo;We want always
to be your friends,&rdquo; she ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the other se&ntilde;orita,&rdquo; Carlitos
said, shining eyed. &ldquo;I want her to be a partner
in my mine, too. Tell my uncle that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence turned and repeated this to Mr.
Eldridge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>He smiled back at her, then at Dr. Blackwell.
&ldquo;We have already arranged for her to
have some shares also. I&rsquo;m going to see that
Jos&eacute; and his family are well taken care of the
rest of their lives, too. They have been so good
to my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be fine!&rdquo; exclaimed both girls together.</p>
<p>Jo Ann pressed Florence&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
glad! They deserve to, after all they&rsquo;ve been
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jo Ann squeezed Florence&rsquo;s hand tightly, her
eyes like twin stars. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say that
Esperanza means hope? It&rsquo;ll mean new hope
now for Carlitos and Jos&eacute; and his family&mdash;and
for us too. Let&rsquo;s call it the New Hope Mine
from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grand idea!&rdquo;</p>
